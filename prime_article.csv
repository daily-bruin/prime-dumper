2,1,Toe Shoes to Textbooks: Retired ballerina finds balance at UCLA,toe-shoes-textbooks,prime/fall-2013/lead/ballerina5.jpg,"Victoria Canelos, 28, is a fourth-year physiology student. Before transferring to UCLA she was a professional ballerina, an experience she carries with her.","[img6 right]

If a younger Victoria Canelos wasn’t wearing toe shoes eight hours a day, she was probably wondering why she was even waking up.

Her mother introduced her to ballet when she was 4 years old, and by the time she was 8, the now 28-year-old physiology student at UCLA said she was sure she wanted to be a ballerina.

She didn’t think a career in ballet would leave time for college.

And when she was consistently told she would never make it as a professional ballerina, she kept pushing to show she could be the best.

At 13, she was invited to study at the Kirov Academy of Ballet’s branch in Washington, D.C., a boarding school for classical ballet that accepted a few students from around the world.

“If I said no, that would have been the end of her professional dance life,” said her mother, Victoria Canelos Sr. “I always told my children you’re gonna get older whether or not you sit on the couch eating bonbons, or if you achieve your dreams.”

It was at the academy that she first started to turn to eating disorders to deal with her only persistent imperfection from a ballet standpoint: her weight. The pressure to conform to the ballet world’s idea of a perfect body, mixed with loneliness and exhaustion, at times tempted her to go home.

""(But) there was nothing for me in Tucson, so I refused to come home,” she said.

Her talent took her across the country and around the world, leading as Clara in multiple productions of “The Nutcracker” and performing in Prague.

She eventually stopped for her health and enrolled in community college to pursue an education, a way to get fulfillment even after an early retirement.

“You can understand walking on the fine line between (being) so in love with something and willing to do whatever it takes to do it,” she said. “If you cross that line for a second who knows if you’ll be able to come back.”

# Ballerina boarding school

The routine at the academy was unlike any American school she had heard of or experienced. Practicing ballet six days a week, often for more than eight hours a day, left little time for making friends or academics – and the prevailing use of French and Russian by her demanding instructors meant she was always around an interpreter.

[img7 right]

She still remembers when Madame Sizova told her that her 90-year-old grandmother had better feet.

And when she told her she could see Canelos’ Thanksgiving dinner from last year.

They told her if she didn’t look good in a tutu, it didn’t matter how perfect her form was.

“Weight was my whole experience as a dancer professionally, and in school,” Canelos said. “Weight was the first thing I thought about in the morning. Weight is the last thing I thought about before I went to bed.”

But then she also remembers when she finished her recital and received a kiss on the cheek and Madame Sizova told her she had never been more proud in her life.

Those moments made it worth it.

# Life without a backup plan

Canelos graduated from the ballet academy in 2003 as valedictorian.

Despite her success, she did not get any offers from companies.

“None of us had plan Bs,” she said.

She auditioned for the Miami City Ballet in Florida. The director expressed concern that Canelos was not their style, although her technique was up to par.

[img9 fullwidth]

Canelos asked him if she could stay for the summer. She told him she would prove she could fit in with the company.

She lost weight – probably too much. She mimicked the other dancers. Ate what they ate. Dressed like them. She “went method,” so to speak.

And by the end of the summer, she landed the job.

Her determination was effective again after an audition in New York in 2006.

Competing against thousands of girls, she almost made it into her favorite company, Complexions Contemporary Ballet – but finished in second place.

With what she considers a stroke of luck, the company called a few days later and said she needed to be at work on Monday. One of the ballerinas had broken her hip.

She decided to take a chance. She immediately withdrew from her dance classes at the University of Arizona, packed her bags and flew by herself to a city where she knew nobody. Canelos took the job without a contract, hoping she might be allowed to stay.

The catch was that she had nowhere to live and no time to sort out any arrangements. At the beginning, she stayed with family in New Jersey and commuted every day at 5 a.m. Eventually this routine became impractical.

So she stayed a few days here and there, renting out spare bedrooms for a couple of days at a time, finding listings on Craigslist, until she finally found an apartment.

“It was my first time as an adult in New York. I was just there to dance and working really hard,” she said. “I felt like I was living the dream.”

# A book for her thoughts

While in New York, a woman started giving Canelos books to read in her free time. She remembers the first was “The Pillars of the Earth.”

A slow and enthralling read, it kept her attention long enough to finish the book – something she had never experienced before. Reading had not been a priority in her life thus far. As she began to read more, she found herself wondering what it might be like to be in school again.

That, she said, mixed with her constant struggle with weight and eating disorders, led her to make the choice she had previously refused.

“As much as I love ballet, I (thought) I might not be cut out for it as much as I thought I was. I thought I might die sooner than I should. It was a difficult decision for me,” she said.

[img8 left]

Bouts of anorexia and laxative abuse had led her to hospitalization and a history of what she calls “weird eating habits.”

Being a ballerina in New York, and a ballerina for Complexions specifically, was like being at the top of the social hierarchy.

“I loved being a big deal,” Canelos said, laughing.

However, her eating disorders and rigorous dance schedule meant she couldn’t socialize and eat with friends, making it difficult to enjoy her success.

She thought quitting ballet might give her a chance to do something more with her life.

“(I was once told) it doesn’t matter what it feels like to you, Victoria, it matters what other people see. As much as it is lovely to bring joy to the audience, it’sso self-centered and so self-absorbed. I can’t tell you what a relief it is to not be in a career like that anymore.”

# Back to school

She enrolled at Orange Coast College in Orange County in 2010, starting with high school-level math since she had not taken many standard academic course sat the academy.

Her academic history made her eligible for Extended Opportunity Programs andServices, an academic counseling program for educationally or financially disadvantaged students.

“She started here, but because of her intelligence she is capable of doing anything, and more important than anything is her wonderful heart,” said Vida Shajie,an academic counselor and professor of counseling services.

Canelos became the president of the program’s honors club and emphasized community service during her term. Service was something she said she realized she loved, but hadn’t frequently experienced as a ballerina on a cutthroat stage.

Of her two years at community college, she said her most rewarding experience was when she helped raise money for the adult transition program on campus.

When she asked around and learned their department was sponsored by a state program and didn’t have enough funding, she personally wrote grants and went door to door to raise $12,000 for new iPads, clothing, furniture, microwaves and toys.

“I have never felt so worthy of my life than I did then,” she said. She described it as the second happiest time in her life. The first would always be her first ballet job.

Since then, Canelos said she knew she wanted to work with underserved populations.

Her mother, whom she considers “a far more interesting woman” than herself,might be responsible for her desire to help people. Around the time Canelos was in elementary school, her mother, a nurse,spent a year in Panama and brought her children with her.

While her mother was working to help struggling mothers in Panama support their families, Canelos would practice ballet and play with the local children.

The bumpy, warped dance floors at the studio in Panama introduced her to dancers with lifestyles different than the ones she was used to.

# Pursuing medicine

[img10 fullwidth]

Since transferring to UCLA in 2012, Canelos has pursued research and education to prepare her for medical school.

“I feel like it’s in my blood to do something like that,” Canelos said about helping people. “I’m a care extender (at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center) – I have the best time ever as a care extender.”

She said she particularly enjoys working with the children in the intensive care unit.

“I take them on walks,” she said. “I don’t care if it’s (just) in a circle around their room.”

Sometimes she brings her nail polish and paints the little girls’ nails.

“She’s lived her whole life looking at her body in the mirror, studying the way it functions,” her mother said. “Medicine makes sense.”

The transition to medicine has at times been difficult. But being a doctor is worth the struggle, she said.

Like ballet, it takes discipline.

“You really can’t be successful or enjoy your life (as either) unless you love both of them,” she said. “If you’re going be a really good doctor you’re going to do research, you’re going to make sure patients have the best care.”

Regardless, nobody will ever convince her that being a doctor is better than being a ballerina, she said.

“I want to be a doctor more than any- thing. And I will be a doctor. (But) that will never come out of my mouth to even compare,” she said. “(It’s) like comparing apples to blueberries.”

Ballet is something she will always take with her.

“I think we have 50 toe shoes she can’t give away, or 75 leotards she can’t seem to get rid of,” her mother said, laughing.

On Saturdays, Canelos still practices ballet in Los Angeles.

[img11 fullwidth]

“There is nothing like walking up to a ballet bar and putting up my left hand and coming into first position and stacking (my) spine and pelvis ... nothing like putting myself in there and being so centered and knowing that is the most comfortable place for me,” she said, smiling.

“Doing the very first plié for me is like eating after not eating for a long time. It’s like being starved and here is some warm soup for you.”",0,""
3,1,Recipe: Apple pie pops usher in flavors of fall,apple-pie-pops-recipe,prime/fall-2013/lead/piepops12.jpg,"In the spirit of fall, food blogger Amy Giroux cooks up some apple pie pops using an online recipe.","The cake pop craze is dying down just in time for its hipper cousin, the pie pop, to steal the scene.

Introducing the apple pie pop, in all of its fall flavor glory. The start of a new school year brings new adventures, cozy clothes, pumpkin spice lattes and a revisiting of all of fall season’s favorite recipes.

Relatively simple to make, this “pinteresting” recipe is a winning addition to any dinner party, afternoon picnic, Sunday afternoon baking session, study snack, late-night splurge or even breakfast treat.

# Ingredients:

[img12 fullwidth]

- 4 Fuji apples, peeled and medium-small diced

- ¼ cup white sugar, plus 1/8 teaspoon white sugar for egg wash

- ¼ cup brown sugar

- 2 tablespoons honey

- ½ teaspoon cinnamon

- 3 tablespoons apricot jam (can be substituted with strawberry or peach for different flavors)

- 2 tablespoons corn starch

- 2 tablespoons water

- 1 egg yolk

- ¼ cup milk

- Kosher salt

- 2 refrigerated pie crusts

# Instructions:

[img13 fullwidth]

Preheat oven to 400° F. In a medium saucepan, bring apples, sugar, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, jam and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt to a light simmer on medium-low heat. Simmer for 15-20 minutes on low heat with the saucepan uncovered.

----------

[img14 fullwidth]

Combine water and corn starch with a fork to create a slurry, and slowly pour into the apple mixture while stirring. Let cook for 2 minutes. Take off the heat and let cool.

----------

[img15 fullwidth]

Prepare egg wash by mixing an egg yolk, milk, 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/8 teaspoon sugar. (not pictured)

----------

[img16 fullwidth]

Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. Take out one refrigerated pie crust and cut out as many circles as possible (around 12). Place them on the parchment paper. Place the lollipop sticks at the top of each pie circle and push them in, but not so they go all the way through the circle.

----------

[img17 fullwidth]

Place around 1 to 2 teaspoons of apple filling in the middle of each pie circle. Roll out the second pie crust and cut out the same number of circles as from the first pie crust.

----------

[img18 fullwidth]

Brush egg wash using the back of a spoon or a pastry brush on the rim around the filling for the pie pops. Cover the filling and seal with the remaining pie circles. Press the edges together with a fork and poke holes into the tops of each pie, just puncturing the crust.

----------

[img19 fullwidth]

Brush the tops with more egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 400° F for 15-20 minutes, or just until the crust is golden brown.

----------

[img20 fullwidth]

## Tips from our kitchen to yours:

- Don’t skip the apricot jam or corn starch in this recipe – these are the secrets to perfect consistency in the pie filling.

- Mix and match the apples to your taste for a full realm of flavors – we used a combination of Pink Lady, Fuji and Gala.

- Healthier substitutions can also be made with agave in lieu of honey, and coconut milk in lieu of whole milk.

- No lollipop sticks? No problem. Chopsticks make the perfect substitute (and dare we say they’re even more effective because they are substantial enough to hold the surprisingly weighty little pie).

- If you can, try to resist the temptation to eat the pops right away. Allowing them to cool will prevent the pies from sliding down the sticks.

6,1,A Perfect Day in LA: Exploring Downtown Los Angeles’ Grand Central Market,exploring-downtown-la-grand-central-market,prime/fall-2013/lead/grandcentral9.jpg,Prime staff spent an afternoon at Grand Central Market and shared their experience with readers as part of the quarterly series “Perfect Day in LA.”,"*The original version of this article contained an error and has been changed. See the bottom of the article for additional information.*

Each quarter, prime staff will try something new in Los Angeles and share their “Perfect Day in LA” with readers. This issue, Alessandra Daskalakis and Erin Ng took a Sunday afternoon trip to Grand Central Market, located at 317 S. Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles.

Walking into the market is sensory overload.

Old friends sit at booths, hunch at counters, laughing and drinking from glass bottles of Mexican Coca-Cola with the telltale “refresco” written on the labels. Families with two, three, even five children crowd picnic tables eating and smiling.

The air is filled with the smell of cooking meats and Asian food.

The conversations are complemented by the fast-paced pitter-patter of capable hands shaping pupusas.

An occasional burst of steam from the grills and rays of sun shining through from the other side of the street give the impression that the market itself is taking deep breaths.

Vendors at the market offer primarily Latin and Asian cuisine, each with a slightly different take on the menu.

China Cafe, a Chinese diner located at the back of the market, serves boiled noodles, egg fo yeung and other fare. Many of the customers drink Corona and coffee brews in coffee pots on the counter. Mexican hot sauces adorn the tables, ready to spike up the spice of wonton soups.

[img36 fullwidth]

Behind containers of hundreds of chiles from Mexico and mounds of dry beans, Angel Yépez stands, smiling. He has been watching us walk around taking photos and talking to tenants. He knows it’s his turn.

He welcomes us to Valeria’s and we ask which chili is the best.

“Guajillo,” he says. It’s their best seller — good for making menudo and enchiladas.

Valeria’s is one of the few booths that has been at the market since it opened in 1917. Yépez has been working there since the ’80s.

He says the booth regularly attracts photographers and points to a customer with a camera. In fact, as I’m talking to him, Erin walks around snapping photos of the colorful chiles in transparent containers. From the beginning she had scoped this booth out as a good photo opportunity.

[img33 fullwidth]

We asked Yépez if he has seen the market change and he nods his head right away.

He says in the past two years he has seen more white customers at the traditionally Latino market. He said he is curious to see what the demographic will be in the next eight months.

A couple of booths away, a chalkboard menu and a Twitter handle advertise Valerie at Grand Central Market, a diner serving items like kale hand pie and salmon bahn mi. Yepéz wonders if the higher prices will make it difficult for some customers to afford.

Around the corner from Valeria’s is Sarita’s Pupuseria, a family business open since 1983.

[img34 fullwidth]

I watch, mesmerized by the pupusa prepping process, and eventually ask if I can speak to someone about the shop. A woman directs me to Candelario Serrano Ayon, who is helping a young girl and her father. As Ayon works the cash register, the father and daughter ask us if we’ve had the pupusas. Not yet.

I can’t help but ask how many pupusas they might make in a day. But Ayon laughs and just says “a lot.”

I start with the same set of questions I have been asking the other vendors.

“What do you like about the market?”

[img31 right]

The diversity, he says. All different kinds of people come to eat.

When I told him I was a reporter, he smiled, leaned over the counter and pointed to a booth just to his right, insisting we talk to his brother, who runs a jewelry booth that opened in 1988.

Like her brother-in-law, Sara Clark, who helps run her husband’s jewelry booth, said some aspects of the market have changed, but the constant hustle and bustle has always kept her from getting bored. Even as she speaks to me she curiously looks around at the goings on, trying to find the right words in Spanish to prove her point. Sometimes she looks back at her husband to confirm the dates. He’s eating the wonton soup from China Cafe.

[img30 left]

Ramon Molina, who works at Torres Produce, is a little less optimistic about the market compared to his peers. Molina, who has been with the booth since its opening in 1985, said he has seen the market go through many changes recently. He points behind him to the future site of Belcampo Meat Co., an organic butcher shop.

He said it makes him nervous because the previous vendor had been at the market longer than they have. Adjusting his Boston Rockets hat, he said bad weather in Mexico has affected their produce and profits as of late.

The future feels uncertain. Recently, customers have asked if it is true the booth will leave, but he said all he can say is “I don’t know.” As he points to a photo on a wall a few feet away, my attention is brought to an image of the market 50 years ago.

Changes to Grand Central Market are not unknown to Angelenos.

Wanting to know about the changes myself, I later spoke to Christophe Farber, director of business development for the market.

[img29 right]

He said the market has 10 new vendors since late 2012, four of which are already open. After their leasing term was up, some previous vendors chose to leave. When this happened, the owners of the market took the opportunity to find new tenants that would reflect the changing demographic of downtown Los Angeles and the city’s evolving food culture.

“People are starting to pay more attention to the origin and history of the meats and produce,” Farber said.

That explains DTLA Cheese and Belcampo Meat Co., both of which are opening soon. But that doesn’t mean the older vendors are going anywhere.

“We have the best pupusas in town,” he said, laughing.

Some of the oldest businesses in the market not only have a history, but are also thriving, Farber said. It wouldn’t make sense to get rid of them and there is no pressure for vendors to leave.

It’s true that some of the prices will be higher, but that’s just the way it is.

[img32 left]

“The demographic of the market is in the same state of flux as the city and downtown Los Angeles,” he said. “You see a lot more urban dwellers, so we’re trying to make a direct effort to address everyone.”

Before heading home I saw a woman eating by herself at a table for two under a yellow-tile archway. She looked like a regular and I wanted to know what she thought about the changes.

Nervously, I introduced myself in Spanish as a UCLA student. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. At first she looked confused, but as I elaborated that I wanted to share stories from the market in the magazine, she introduced herself as Maria Gomez. She likes to walk to the market for lunch after work.

We talked about her favorite tacos, pork and intestines, and how she had been coming to the market for many years now.

When I asked if she had seen the market change, she shook her head. Families still come and enjoy good food together. What makes the market great is its ability to get us away from the busy life just outside its boundaries.

“The market is the only distraction we have from home, isn’t it?” she said in Spanish, laughing.

After a couple of minutes I thanked her for her time and apologized for my broken, self-conscious Spanish. She lit up with a warm smile, encouraging me.

“The only thing that matters is that we understand each other,” she said in Spanish. “And we did.”

I’d say it was a pretty perfect day in Los Angeles.

1,1,A Grandfather's Legacy: Saffron and Rose Ice Cream owners carry on tradition,saffron-rose-ice-cream,prime/fall-2013/lead/icecream.jpg,"Saffron & Rose is a popular Persian ice cream shop south of Wilshire. Since his grandfather died, Fred Papen and his family have been continuing the legacy.","[img1 right]

Just about a block or two south of Wilshire a line forms out the door of a small shop. Inside, customers are greeted by cool air and the familiar, sweet smell of ice cream.

“That’s the best seller,” Fred Papen said, pointing to the pastel green-colored Saffron Pistachio ice cream in the display case.He carefully scoops out a small sample with a plastic spoon and gives it to a customer, something he has done since he was about 5 years old.

He switches between English and Farsi throughout the night, serving customers who know the shop well and introducing the flavors to curious newcomers.
Up until three years ago, his late grandfather’s voice would energize this popular Persian ice cream shop on Westwood Boulevard.

Haji Ali Kashani-Rafye isn’t around anymore, but his picture decorates the white containers of Saffron & Rose Ice Cream – a tribute to the man who built the business with his honesty, charismatic personality and broken English.

“My grandfather was so old, yet he connected with everyone – all ages, all races,” Papen said. “Even people that didn’t understand his English very well – he still connected with them.”

# Coming to America

Kashani-Rafye immigrated to California from Iran in 1974 to be closer to his son, who was studying in the U.S. and wanted to settle down in the country.

He used his father’s secret saffron ice cream and rose ice cream recipes to open a small grocery and ice cream shop in Santa Monica.

After changing locations a few times over the years, Kashani-Rafye settled down in the heart of Little Persia, a small enclave of Persian businesses that overlaps with Westwood.

Kashani-Rafye decided to open an ice cream shop in a more accessible location as word of his ice cream spread.

Unsure of what to name the place, his grandson suggested it seemed fitting to name it after his two most popular flavors: saffron and rose.

Saffron ice cream, bright yellow in color, is bittersweet. Rose ice cream on the other hand, is white, smells like rose water and has chunks of high quality cream called “khameh” incorporated into the authentic Persian ice cream.

“When it comes to cold desserts (in Persia), those two pretty much take the cake,” Papen said.

Saffron & Rose Ice Cream is now one of the biggest brands of Persian ice cream in the United States and sold nationwide.

Persian ice cream stands apart from its American and Italian counterparts with its use of whole milk. American ice cream is made from powdered milk and gelato uses both milk and water.

[img4 fullwidth]

“If you take a spoon (of Persian ice cream) and pull it from a cup, it would behave like melted cheese,” Papen said. “It stretches instead of breaking up.”
Kashani-Rafye spent almost 40 years working in his shop after immigrating to the United States, trying to perfect his secret ice cream recipes.

He died in 2010 after having a heart attack, leaving the business in his family’s hands.

Though it was hard to come to terms with her father’s sudden death, Fery Kashani said she and her brother felt comfortable taking charge because of the support they got from the community.

Hundreds of people attended Kashani-Rafye’s funeral and memorial ceremony. Now, three years later, people still come by the shop and talk about how they miss Kashani-Rafye. It happens multiple times every day, Papen said.

As Kashani and Papen sat outside Saffron & Rose to discuss the business’ history on a chilly September night, they occasionally paused to greet their regular customers as if they were longtime friends.

Caren Avedon, a Westwood resident, visits the shop a couple of times a week, sometimes bringing her sister along with her.

Avedon, 54, first discovered the ice cream shop when she was at a wine tasting on a patio nearby.

Although she moved out of the area soon after, Avedon rediscovered the shop while visiting a nearby restaurant last year after moving back. She went inside to have some ice cream for dessert, remembering the nice man with an infectious laugh who had served her ice cream a year before.

[img5 fullwidth]

“It’s just like you see it right now  – how it’s all family. People from every walk of life come here and they are just happy,” Avedon said.

Children, students, professionals and retirees stopped by to get ice cream on one busy Friday night. Papen would often make flavor suggestions to newcomers.

“(Papen) gave me a dark chocolate chip with orange blossom ice cream and that was it – I was hooked for life,” Avedon said.

Customers keep coming back to Saffron & Rose, not only because of the good ice cream, but because of the legacy that Kashani-Rafye left behind.

“He just left a good name behind him. In our community, everybody knows (of) him,” Kashani said. “And I am so proud and happy that people like us, they know us.”

# Growing up in the shop

Papen remembers his secret handshake with his grandfather. After an elaborate combination of fist bumps, they would end by touching their thumbs together in the form of a thumbs-up.

From wrestling and secret handshakes to learning life lessons, Papen spent as much time as possible with his grandfather when he was younger.

[img3 left]

He grew up around his grandfather’s ice cream shop, pretending to serve customers under his grandfather’s supervision.

Kashani-Rafye adored Papen and tried to involve him in the family business early on. When he was 10 years old, Papen took on small tasks like cleaning windows.

Little by little, he started getting more involved.

“One day turned into two days, three days, more hours,” Kashani said.

In high school, Papen would stop by after class to help clean up and stock the shelves.

He got his first job at the shop when he was 19-years-old, driving ice cream across Southern California in a Ford cargo van.

Papen didn’t really consider working at Saffron & Rose until he experienced what it was like to work for other businesses.

Taking a few years off from attending California State University, Northridge, he worked odd jobs – at a local restaurant in Westwood, at a golf course and as an after-school coach at Culver City Middle School.

“I realized it’s not much of an investment. I work twelve hours a day, I get a paycheck and that’s it,” he said. “I can get fired tomorrow and that’s it for me.”
And so he decided to get more involved with Saffron & Rose, where he could do more than just clock in and out.

# The next generation

[img2 right]

Even though he’s the newest addition to the Saffron & Rose management, Kashani said her son’s insight is valuable.

Kashani oversees the managerial aspects of the business, while her brother Mike Kash is responsible for product development and distribution.
The family didn’t do much marketing early on – business grew through word of mouth, Kash said.

Papen, however, wants to take a new approach by focusing on branding and advertising.

Running a family business does have its challenges, Kashani said.

“She’s my mom and my boss, so we’ll argue about ice cream (as work) and then when we go home, we’ll argue about whatever,” Papen said. “You can never get away from it.”

He constantly tries to apply the lessons he learned from his grandfather to his day-to-day work at Saffron & Rose.

Sometimes, Papen will give a child free ice cream or offer samples to customers, just like his grandfather used to.

“Watching him, I realized how effective it is to give someone something, even if it costs a dollar. It just causes good karma and vibes to go around,” Papen said, as he pointed to his grandfather’s portrait on the shop’s window.

That sense of community, he said, is why Saffron & Rose is so special to him.

“I see it as something that will help me financially grow in the future, “ Papen said. “But more importantly, I see it like a continuation of my grandfather and what he left behind.”

Kashani looked at her son and nodded in agreement.

“Yes. … We’re keeping his name alive, that’s the most important thing for us,” Kashani added.",8,""
5,1,Seen Not Heard: Experience of overweight students on campus often overlooked,seen-not-heard,prime/fall-2013/lead/alex2.jpg,"Alexandra Tashman, an opinion columnist at the Daily Bruin, writes about what it’s like being overweight at UCLA. This is a story she has wanted to tell.","November 12, 2013

[img28 fullwidth]

I’m overweight. And I don’t mean that in the “let-me-stand-in-front-of-my-Forever-21-dressing-room-and-have-my-friends-bolster-my-self-esteem” kind of way. I mean that in the honest to God, “I-should-star-in-a-Nutrisystem-commercial” sense.

I’ve been overweight throughout my over two-year journey at UCLA so far and, although it’s been a happy one, this is one facet of my life I cannot ignore, even when I want to. To be overweight on a college campus is to be invisible at best, and too visible at worst. It’s harder to make friends when you’re overweight, but everyone notices when you fall down a flight of stairs.

The reason I want to write publicly about this is not because I’m looking for anyone to tell me how to go on a diet, or to make judgments on my life or on the lives of other overweight UCLA community members. But for all we talk about diverse points of view and experiences on this campus, the day-to-day struggle of being overweight is nearly always forgotten.

Why? Do we, as a society, look at overweight people and think that it’s their fault? That it’s just a matter of willpower? That someone needs to just tell them to diet and exercise and the problem will solve itself? That they’re choosing to be this way?

Everybody’s story is different. Some people are overweight because of medical conditions and genetics. Binge eating disorder is a leading cause of obesity for many and will continue to be recognized as such. And some people are just overweight and are perfectly healthy.

Because our campus is located practically in Bel Air, UCLA students may be more vulnerable to the pressures of Hollywood and the media. As an overweight student here, and a lifelong resident, I know that I have keenly felt the pressure to look and dress a certain way.

It is because of this backdrop that I think it is especially important to let the voices of people who are overweight be heard, to share some of the less-nice aspects of being a UCLA student.

My experience here has been rich and multifaceted, but the moments where I have been reduced to nothing but my weight are just as telling as those when I have felt invincibly happy. Here are a few stories about what being overweight on UCLA’s campus has felt like to me.

On my first day of classes at UCLA, I spent 25 minutes crying in the women’s bathroom in Broad Art Center.

I had always loved the first day of school: discovering new rooms and pathways, meeting new people, developing new routines in my head. Having fantasized about starting college since I knew it existed, my mind was full of romantic and idealized notions of what college lectures and professors would be like. I probably should have spent less time watching “Gilmore Girls” growing up.

Anyway, I was running late to my first class – European history, my favorite – and by the time I finally found the right classroom I was completely out of breath. Trying to figure out where I could sit without looking too eager, I picked an aisle desk somewhere near the front and attempted to sit down.

I didn’t fit.

I didn’t fit in the chair – I was just too big. No matter which way I leaned, which leg I crossed, I could not squeeze my way into that chair. I felt like everyone was staring at me. Eventually, I managed to defy physics and somehow squish myself into the seat before laughably trying to put the desk down over my stomach. That didn’t fit either.

Resigning myself to feeling uncomfortably scrunched, I looked over to see the girl next to me glaring – my shoulders and arms were taking up some of her space.

At the end of class, my legs sore from keeping them in one contorted position for too long, my scowling neighbor turned to me and suggested that I find better seating during the next lecture so I wouldn’t be a problem for anyone else. But what constitutes “non-problematic” seating in a lecture hall filled with identical chairs?

Tired and frustrated, I walked out of the room, into the second floor bathroom, locked myself in a stall and cried. I was so embarrassed that I couldn’t remember what the eagerly anticipated lecture had even been about.

This was not what college was supposed to be like.

In February of my freshman year, I was sitting in De Neve dining hall during dinner.

I was eating a sandwich and waiting for my friend to finish filling her tray when a blond girl I didn’t know sat down right across from me at my table. I looked up, surprised, and said hello.

In short, she told me that the salad bar was on the other side of the dining hall, and she wanted to make sure I knew where it was in case I needed any help with my diet.

But more importantly, I’ll never forget the exact wording of what she said to me next: “Believe me, if you stick to the salad bar, you’ll be looking acceptable in no time.”

Sometimes, I walk the track at Drake Stadium because it’s flat and well lit at night. Occasionally, I’ll even make an attempt at jogging a lap.

It takes a lot for me to work myself up into going over to the track. Workout clothes are enough of a nightmare, not to mention the fact that I often have to go alone if my friends are busy.

One night, in the middle of my second year, as I was jogging along and completely out of breath, I heard someone laugh. Then several people laughed, before they were shushed by the rest of their friends.

I looked over to see a group of guys sitting in the bleachers. They were looking right back at me. Another one laughed loudly before being silenced again.

It took me about a minute to realize they were laughing at me – the idea of my jogging was funny to them. Fat people running has been a comedic trope in film and television for decades, and in an instant I had gone from normal human being to Chunk from “The Goonies.”

Humiliated, I slowed to a walk as one guy kept laughing. I don’t think I’ve gone jogging since.

The point of telling these stories is not to engender sympathy. Rather, they are meant to demonstrate the ways in which everyday activities can become incidents of shame and embarrassment because of something as pointlessly divisive as weight.

Why does body weight change the value and character of another human being? What is so bad about fat that it makes public mockery acceptable?

Whether I am actively trying to lose weight or not, I wake up every day with the knowledge that people are judging me on sight for something they don’t understand. They don’t know my story, but immediately they will make assumptions about me.

And it is precisely for that reason that I devote my time to making sure people understand there is more to me than my weight – I am funny, I am kind, I drink a lot of coffee and can name every British monarch from memory – and none of that has anything to do with size. The fact that I have to consciously dedicate time to trying to prove I am normal says a lot more about our culture than my weight says about me.

Everybody has laughed at a fat joke. People every day are complicit in the public shame and mockery of those who are overweight. The reason I tell these stories, more than anything, is to raise consciousness about what it is like to be overweight every day – the small, completely undeserved injustices and indignities that are painful and often completely preventable.

It is scary to tell your stories, to fear that others will judge you or laugh at you. But I live my life undeterred – I am here, I am not invisible, and I am no less because of how big I am.",4,""

[img22 fullwidth]

Pick your map of choice. Maps with a glossy finish will not work as well for this craft. Add two tablespoons of instant coffee to two cups of hot water and stir to dissolve. The more coffee you add, the darker your map will be. Let the coffee come to room temperature.

----------

[img23 fullwidth]

Unfold your map to a size that fits comfortably into your baking tray. You should have the map side face up in order to soak in more color. Pour the coffee on top of the map, making sure it is completely wet. You may have to push the map down deeper into the tray in order to get full coverage once the coffee is added.

----------

[img24 fullwidth]

Let the map soak for 10 to15 minutes, flipping it over about halfway through. Carefully take the map out of the tray, letting any remaining coffee drip back into the tray. The map is fragile and can easily rip if not handled carefully.

# Blazers

Most college students own a blazer in some form or another, whether it is collecting dust until their next job interview or part of their everyday style.

Blazers are extremely versatile. When you’re hurrying off to class, they will put your look together instantly, and they are also perfect for dining out or dressing up.

There are no rules, but men tend to prefer a darker-toned jacket. A well-cut blazer will instantly make a fun graphic tee a little more serious, without being boring. Women are often spotted wearing bright blazers, which look fantastic over otherwise neutral tones, on a daily basis and for fancier events.

# Pants

Another easy way to make a simple look much more fun is to pair it with some statement pants.

Although you might not want to wear these for a gala, first date or meeting with the dean, they are great for your daily stroll around campus or a casual evening out with your friends.

It is usually safer to pair bright or loudly patterned pants with basic staples, possibly in black, white or gray, in order to avoid pattern overkill. As a general rule, keeping it simple and classy will make even the craziest of pants an integral part of an elegant outfit.

# Boat shoes

Boat shoes and men’s loafers have been around for a while. They were probably most of our grandfathers’ shoe of choice back in the day. Does this mean that they can’t be cool? Absolutely not.

These shoes are a classic for young men and women alike. Wear them to class, for dinner or a night out, and you’ll always look the part. A preppy piece, boat shoes work incredibly well with boat shorts and a T-shirt or button-up, but can also be worn with jeans – or even a suit. For women as well, these shoes are a staple for any occasion. They not only make a sleek finishing touch to a cute dress, but also work for skinny jeans and a pretty top.

8,1,A Feast for Your Ryes: Los Angeles’ tried and true late-night delis,los-angeles-late-night-delis,prime/fall-2013/lead/canters2.jpg,A good sandwich is a lot more than a quick meal. Digital Managing Editor Kate Parkinson-Morgan found some of LA’s best delis and tried the pastrami at each.,"The word “deli” conjures up a few classic images.

Among them, a few gruff, plump men serving piles of steaming-hot pastrami sandwiches to a long line of impatient New Yorkers.

“You want me to show you what the New York deli mentality is?” asks Norm Langer, owner of Langer’s Deli in Downtown Los Angeles. He leans in, rumples his brow and puts on a thick New York accent, “I’m gonna tell you what you want and that’s what you’re gonna get.”

In Los Angeles, that motto doesn’t fly. Customers want friendly service, a solid dose of nostalgia and a sandwich that makes a statement.

The price they’re willing to pay for these qualities isn’t cheap. All the hand-cut and cured meats, made-fresh coleslaws and piles of pickles add up.

While there may be a dearth of traditional delis in Westwood, there are plenty in the greater Los Angeles area. Here are four spots worth checking out. For the sake of consistency, we sampled the signature sandwich at each location.

# Izzy’s Deli

- “The Deli Next Door”
- 1433 Wilshire Blvd. Santa Monica, CA 90403
- Open 24 hours
- Established: 1973

[img69 fullwidth]

There's a kind of understanding among deli connoisseurs that sandwiches are more than, well, just sandwiches. They’re infused with history, constructed with care and, in the case of Izzy’s, they are named after loved ones, dead and alive.

Owner Izzy Freeman, the “Deli Lama” as the back of the menu proudly proclaims, named most of his dishes after friends and family. Servers greet you with a warm smile as you enter from the corner of 15th Street and Wilshire Boulevard, and ask whether you’d like to sit at the counter, facing the noisy kitchen, or in one of the cozy booths.

[img55 left]

The pastrami – rather, Craig’s Hot Pastrami – is peppered to perfection, tender and not too salty. Izzy’s sandwiches are double-stacked with layers of bread and meat. The pastrami-bread ratio is a delicate balance, one bite into too much pastrami and you might feel like you’re sinking your teeth into a salty cow carcass. The Izzy’s version of the pastrami sandwich, with the alternating layers of bread, double-baked fresh every day, offsets the meat’s saltiness.

Although the meat packs a peppery punch, you can choose to add horseradish, hot or sweet mustard, or a Gulden’s brand deli mustard to add an extra kick. We recommend leaving the mustard on the side, however. Slathering too much mustard on the sandwich can overwhelm the delicate flavor of the pastrami.

The pickles – of which they’ve sold more than 6 million, according to the restaurant’s T-shirt – are barreled, instead of jarred, which gives them a fresh crunch and locks in the garlic flavor. Creamy and fresh coleslaw is made in-house, as is potato salad and macaroni salad. Soups are also made fresh daily.

[img57 right]

Again, the service is what really makes the place shine. Waitress Hana Koudelka has been serving at Izzy’s for 40 years, and if you ask her what she likes to eat, she won’t hesitate to detail the merits of Izzy’s brisket, lox and even oatmeal.

Izzy’s is truly the “deli next door,” not only because it’s geographically the closest to Westwood, but also because it’s a dependable, go-to spot for late-night comfort food.

# Canter’s Deli
- “The Institution”
- 419 N. Fairfax Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90036
- Open 24 hours
- Established: 1931

[img70 fullwidth]

Canter’s may have New York flair, but it’s a uniquely L.A. institution. It takes just one look at the breakfast menu (huevos rancheros are listed next to matzo brei) to understand that this is not just another Brooklyn-style deli.

In 1931, New Jersey native Ben Canter and his brothers opened up a delicatessen in Boyle Heights, a mostly Jewish community at the time. Three generations later, Jacqueline Canter co-owns the 24-hour deli at its new location on Fairfax and runs it with her siblings.

The signature sandwiches include the Pastrami Reuben ($14.50), a dense mixture of thinly-sliced smoked beef, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and sweet Russian dressing squeezed between slices of crispy, grilled rye bread.

[img65 fullwidth]

The Canter’s Fairfax, another signature sandwich, is packed with hot corned beef and pastrami on rye bread, served with a side of crunchy cole slaw or creamy potato salad. After eating this sandwich, your jaw aches the way it does after smiling too long for a family photo.

The traditional rye bread, which we recommend rather than the gluten-free option, is made fresh in a bakery above the restaurant. If you’re there at the right time, sometimes you can hear the “whoosh” of the machines as the bread is prepared, according to one Canter’s waitress, Diane Norem. Norem, 55, dined at Canter’s as a child, and she once asked a waitress about the noise. The waitress told her the sound came from the bakers upstairs torturing nosy kids.

For all the talk of the food, it’s really the history of Canter’s that makes this place worth the trip.

“It’s like a home away from home. We’re on a first name basis with a lot of customers,” Canter said. “If they don’t come in, we call them up and make sure they’re okay. It’s like we’re their Jewish mother.”

[img71 fullwidth]

Regular Canter’s customers notice even the minutest changes to service. “You put the mustards in bottles and all of a sudden it’s like, ‘Wait ... the mustards used to be in a jar.’ That took some getting used to,” Norem said.

If you ever grow jaded with some of Los Angeles’ more hipster restaurants, Canter’s is the perfect antidote. Norem puts it best: “People like sameness, and this place never changes.”

# Philippe the Original
- “The Wild Card”
- 1001 N. Alameda St. Los Angeles, CA 90012
- Open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
- Established: 1908

[img66 fullwidth]

[img53 right]

Deli purists will tell you Philippe the Original is no deli. There’s no corned beef and no pastrami. But we’re dubbing Philipe’s the “wild card” because it has some of the essential elements of a deli: hand-crafted sandwiches, a long history of family ownership and nostalgic decor.

Walk through the doors of Philippe’s and you’ll kick up some sawdust on your way in. The sawdust, originally meant to soak up spills on the floor, is one of many touches that helps the restaurant maintain its old-fashioned flavor.

[img58 left]

Instead of pastrami, the mainstay is the Philippe French Dipped Sandwich, a French roll soaked with roast juices and stuffed with your choice of meat – roast beef, roast pork, leg of lamb, turkey or ham.

The roast is a two-day process. The first step involves stewing the meat with celery, onions, carrots, various other vegetables, bay leaves and other spices. The next day, themeat is mixed with garlic salt, then rests in the oven for about three hours.

[img60 right]

We recommend the juicy, tender lamb, carved right off the bone, and paired with the sharp, dry flavor of blue cheese. The beef and swiss cheese is also a classic, but be warned: The beef if fattier than deli-style pastrami. Go for the the double dip (top and bottom), and try the triple dip if you love a soggy sandwich drenched in juices.

The presentation is somewhat drab – your meal comes on gray, disposable cardboard plates – but the magic is in the rich gravy juices.

[img68 fullwidth]

Rumor has it the French gravy dip technique came about by accident. In 1918, restaurant founder Philippe Mathieu dropped a French roll into the roasting pan while serving a police officer. The officer ate the sandwich anyway, and liked it so much, he came back the next day with friends.

# Langer’s
- “The Deli Daddy”
- 704 S. Alvarado St. Los Angeles, CA 90057
- Open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., closed Sundays
- Established: 1947

[img56 right]

It may seem strange to dub Langer’s the“father” of L.A. delis, since it’s certainly not the oldest in town. But Langer’s is a true pop-and-son establishment.

Norm Langer, the current owner, began working at Langer’s alongside his father, Al, in 1962.

[img59 left]

“A deli is a way of life ... it’s a living, breathing entity and you must take care of it,” Langer said after recounting the history of the deli on a sunny Los Angeles afternoon. “It is my child and I raised it.”

If sandwiches were children, the #19 – a pastrami stacked with swiss cheese, cole- slaw and Russian dressing – would be the pride and joy of the family.

Los Angeles Times food critic Jonathan Gold dubbed Langer’s pastrami the best in the United States.

Unlike other deli sandwiches, the #19 doesn’t give you “deli belly,” that piercing stomach pang people commonly experience after pigging out on pastrami.

There are some that would call Langer’s version of pastrami on rye bread sacrilegious. It deviates from the classic meat and bread model and places less importance on mustards. “I don’t carry Grey Poupon (mustard) because I don’t drive a Rolls-Royce,” Langer said with a laugh.

[img63 right]

But the mustard isn’t really necessary when you’ve got creamy coleslaw and Russian dressing to flavor the sandwich. Langer’s Russian dressing is ideal: a rich, tangy sauce that offsets any unintended saltiness or dry flavor of pastrami. The sauce is a well-tuned recipe, with roots tracing back to the kitchens of Langer’s Hungarian and Russian grandmothers.

What really wins you over about the #19, however, is the double-baked bread. After being delivered fresh daily by Fred’s Bakery on Robertson Boulevard, the rye bread is re-baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The result is a moist, soft center surrounded by a crispy, crunchy crust. Al Langer developed the technique as a way to revitalize the bread he ordered from Los Angeles, which often arrived stale via Greyhound bus to Palm Springs, the location of his first deli.

[img67 fullwidth]

“To me, what’s very important is to make you feel like we’re happy you’re here,” said Langer.

As a child, Roderick Tung told his mother that he wanted to be an artist, dentist and conductor. Even as a kid, he wanted to have three jobs.

In college, he pursued the accelerated seven-year medical program at Northwestern University with a voice specialization for his music minor. Even while studying medicine, he entertained the idea of becoming a pop star in Asia.

Today, Tung is an assistant professor of medicine and specializes in cardiology/cardiovascular disease and clinical cardiac electrophysiology at the UCLA Cardiac Arrhythmia Center. But of course, even that isn’t the whole story.

In 2009, staying true to the multifaceted ambitions of his childhood self, he developed TUNG, a self-titled brand of luxury men’s shirts, adding CEO and fashion designer to his formidable catalogue of accomplishments.

[img356 fullwidth]

From moving to Los Angeles for a fellowship at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to traveling to northern Italy to meet with a textile manufacturer who is now his current supplier, Tung is as unafraid as he is ambitious to pursue his passions. prime spoke with Tung about becoming a doctor and a fashion designer, and about choosing not to choose between his two passions.

***

[img353 fullwidth]

prime: Let’s start with the doctor aspect of your career. You clearly have varied interests – what inspired you to pursue medicine?

Roderick Tung: My father was diagnosed with colorectal cancer when I was young. I had to deal with that at a very young age, and it was really one of those situations where I felt that the physicians were really special because they were privy and trained with some knowledge that very few people in society are able to achieve. I felt that it was very empowering, and it helped me appreciate how knowledge is powerful and how health above all things is critical to our lives.

I was always good at science and math, so I followed my strengths. I knew that medicine would be a career that would ultimately be rewarding because of its basic mission, and it was an alignment with my strengths academically.

[img351 fullwidth]

prime: What about fashion? There are a lot of people who like fashion, who appreciate fashion, but very few people choose to pursue it the way you did, especially considering your career path. What inspired you to start your own clothing line when there are many less intensive ways of pursuing an interest in fashion?

RT: I find fashion fascinating at an intellectual level. We all have to wear something every day, because that’s what’s socially acceptable, and we all have a choice in terms of what we wear. What we wear often reflects our moods and our personalities and frequently determines how other people in society interact with us.

Fashion for me was something that not only could fuel an artistic outlet, but it was really using my creative energy to do something that was entrepreneurial. Growing up, my mother was a small-business owner. We opened our own restaurant, and I remember trying to design my mother’s logo for her. I’ve always enjoyed design, and I think that’s why starting this label, for me, was kind of second nature.

[img349 fullwidth]

prime: So it’s been six years since you first established this business. How has TUNG evolved over the years and where do you see it going?

RT: It all started with my obsession with the details in men’s dress shirts and having purchased so many and not feeling like I had the perfect shirt. I was on this quest to come up with an eclectic mixture of all my favorite brands and concepts that I’ve ever seen. The beauty of it is that I have a day job that I am passionate about and this is my hobby. This was me spending money on a hobby that was an investment in myself and a potential new business.

I was basically a one-man show as the sole investor, designer, CEO, marketer and distributor. I hand-delivered my shirts to stores. The highlight of my shirt line so far was in 2011, when I was asked to be the featured men’s designer for Neiman Marcus’ Fashion’s Night Out. Things have never gone to a level that I envisioned, but I’ve realized now that we are limited by 24-hour days, and my medical career has gotten busier and busier.

I haven’t made a new collection in about a year and a half, but I recently went back to Italy and started making new sport jackets and three-piece suits in addition to shirts. My idea now is to try to reinvigorate the brand as more of a custom collection and work with private customers.

[img350 fullwidth]
prime: Fashion and medicine seem to be very different fields to be play in. Do you ever have a difficult time balancing the two?

RT: I think things that really satisfy my soul and my intellectual and creative energy are the constant desire for a clean order, symmetry, perfectionism. It’s the same approach that I have for any medical procedure as I do when I sit down and try to make a great shirt or make a great figure for an academic manuscript.

There is a marriage and there are some unifying themes between both sides. I think that there ways to be creative in medicine as well. I don’t think they are that different. I think fashion as an industry is thought to be relatively anti-academic, and I think medicine as an industry is stereotyped to be absent of creativity and expression.

prime: As you may be aware, UCLA has its own set of stereotypes for the more humanities-oriented North Campus and more science-oriented South Campus. As a doctor and designer, you certainly defy these stereotypes. Have you faced challenges in positioning yourself outside of the traditional expectations of each industry?

RT: One of the things I had hoped to be able to do is to show that those stereotypes are not always true and need not apply to everyone. Everything in life is a spectrum. I think that people need to understand that it is not all or nothing. When I was younger, I thought that everything was black and white. (Now) I realize you have to see where the different ends are and figure out where you fall in.

I had so much fear going into the fashion industry. I didn’t want to tell people I was a doctor. But when they found out I was a physician, they were actually more impressed. People like polymaths, and I think that everyone has a polymath inside them.

[img354 fullwidth]

prime: Many students here at UCLA struggle to balance academic goals with unrelated interests, whether it be through a minor or investing time in other hobby activities. You’ve managed to pursue a career in medicine as well as fashion as a hobby at a level that most people could only dream of. What advice can you give to students who are having difficulty figuring out that balance?

RT: My advice would be to never let go of your passions and never let them go to sleep. We don’t choose our passions. They choose us. That’s what makes each individual different from the next, and that’s what makes life beautiful.

I think we are at our best when we can at least quench our thirsts for our passions from time to time. You’ve been dealt the hand you’ve been dealt for whatever creative energies you have. Students should explore them without fear of being judged for trying to do more than one thing.

prime: Beyond inspiring those interested in medicine or fashion, what do you think students can learn from your story?

RT: One of my favorite figures in history is Leonardo da Vinci. He was an anatomist, a scientist, a philosopher and an artist. And I think there’s something beautiful about that – that it doesn’t need an apology. If you follow your passions, nothing needs to be reconciled because you love it.

I think my story really isn’t about a doctor that does fashion. It is really a story about being true to yourself and harnessing the power of your creative thirst and energy, and going forward and doing things you love to do. It’s more about the human experience and not being afraid of it.",19,""
63,8,A World Away,world-away,prime/spring-2015/lead/Jeong.jpg,Daily Bruin News Editor Jeong Park on the undocumented student experience,"[img368 fullwidth]

Last May, my grandmother had a stroke. I heard about it three days later, nearly 6,000 miles away, sitting in my dim dorm room, clutching my cell phone as my dad called.

I wanted the first flight to Seoul. All I wanted was to touch her.

But as an undocumented immigrant, I couldn’t. Because I have overstayed my six-month tourist visa by nine years, going to Korea means that I would be banned from applying for a visa to the U.S. for the next 10 years. I would be effectively banned from coming back to the U.S. during that time.

The U.S. was, and is, my promised land. I didn’t expect, however, to lose as much of my life as I have.

In Korea, I was a teacher’s pet in elementary school, always getting high grades on tests. My grandparents bragged about the dozens of certificates I got in fourth grade, commemorating different speech and reading contests I had won. I even ran for vice president of my school, failing but keeping the race competitive even when nobody thought I had a chance.

Then, my classmates’ jealousy set in, and the wheels fell off.

My grandmother saw me cry one morning, dreading going to school because my classmates had splashed water on me and laughed at me the day before.

My mom had always wanted me to study in a foreign country. She wanted me to be in a bigger pond, and even had me try living in another country – Australia – where I stayed with my cousin for a month.

[img370 fullwidth]

But she didn’t know when she should send me to the foreign country. After all, changing virtually everything around me was a risky decision.

But as soon as my mom heard that I cried, she had enough. She booked a flight to Los Angeles for herself and me.

When we arrived at the Los Angeles International Airport, my mom told me to tell the customs officer that I came to travel and see the Grand Canyon.

“Don’t speak English,” my mom told me. “Pretend like you don’t know what’s going on.”

I did see the Grand Canyon, but my mom also sent me to a boarding school in Van Nuys that has since closed down. What was meant to be a six-month stay with my visitor’s visa has turned into a nine-year stop (and counting).

Through my nine years in America, I went to school in four different cities and called three strangers whom I lived with my “uncles” just so I didn't have to explain who they were.

I learned to speak English. I enrolled at UCLA, studied political science and became an assistant news editor for the the Daily Bruin. Long gone is the kid who had water poured on him at school – now, I have dozens of friends who genuinely like me.

Legally, conditions for undocumented immigrants have improved since I arrived here.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals has prevented hundreds of thousands from being deported and provided them with work permits (for what it’s worth, I’m still seeking one). Because of the newly passed Assembly Bill 60, many undocumented immigrants can obtain drivers' licenses in California. I don't have to pay tuition because the California Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act made me eligible for a Cal Grant.

Because of efforts from activists who have come out with their status, being undocumented is not as stigmatized as it was when I came to this country.

I have succeeded.

I have achieved the American dream.

These policies and activism have enabled me to come and study at UCLA with relative ease. I have become that ""dreamer"" whom people can point to.

Yet, I ask if that matters.

What is the point of the American dream when your family is 6,000 miles away? What is the point of the American dream when you can’t see your grandparents? What is the point of the American dream when you feel desperately alone?

No policy can make me forget the last nine birthdays I have spent (and the several more I will spend) without my parents.

No policy can bring back the time when my grandfather and I sang Korean folk tunes as we climbed our neighborhood mountain. No policy can restore the memory of spending Chinese New Year – or Seol-Nal – with my cousins and extended family.

I see my mom about twice a year. She is the only family member who can afford to come. For the first couple of years of my stay here, I would cry a night and a day after she left. She would kiss me softly on my cheeks.

Now, the nine-year stay has made me feel detached. I still love it when my mom visits. I still want her to be around, but it isn’t the same. What is point of success if you don’t have anyone to share it with?

I can drive. I can work. But I can’t be with those who love me and whom I love.

Sure, you can tell me that I am just whining, that I should go back to my country, that I have no business being here. I’m an ""illegal,"" after all.

But then, what is the point of the last nine years I spent alone?

[img369 fullwidth]

If I go back, everything I learned and everyone I befriended in the U.S. would essentially be wiped out of my life. I would spend the rest of my life in a country whose people I’m familiar with, but whose customs and culture I’m not. I've heard about them through Korean television and movies, but hearing is different than actually experiencing them.

I have run so far, and roads running the other way have been blocked off.

It’s not that I regret coming here. My mom had me run away from my problems in Korea, and frankly, it worked out well.

Perhaps I’m being too greedy in trying to return to Korea to see my family and also stay in the U.S. to work. But fundamentally, it shouldn’t be an either-or question.

As of now, I’m stuck in a dilemma, trying to deal with the status quo as best as I can.

When I turned 20 last May, when I first heard about my grandmother’s stroke, I wrote this on my blog: “I believe my grandparents will stay strong, but that’s no excuse for not seeing them. ... Hopefully I get to see my grandparents soon, whatever that way may be. I mean, writing this when I get to 21 sounds just, just so depressing.”

Yet, I have just turned 21, with seemingly nothing for me ahead.

My father called me a few weeks ago on my grandmother’s birthday. He passed his phone to my grandmother.

“I lived so long, and I have inconvenienced so many people because of me,” my grandmother told me, saying how her illness has made my grandfather struggle.

I told her that’s not true, that everyone appreciates how she has recovered. But there is only so much emotion, so many things I can tell her over the phone, speaking 6,000 miles away from her house.

If only I could say I love her, to her, with her.",7,""

112,13,Hike LA: Wisdom Tree,hike-la-wisdom-tree,prime/fall-2016/lead/AYU_8792.jpg,"","[img499 fullwidth]

Being from Northern California, I often miss being surrounded by trees, mountains and fresh air rather than palm trees, skyscrapers and smog. Whenever this happens, I’m kindly reminded by my native Los Angeles friends that those things exist in Southern California – they’re just a little harder to find.
This quarter I got in one of those moods in the midst of midterms chaos. In order to regain my sanity (and hopefully some knowledge), I ventured to the Wisdom Tree.
The Wisdom Tree hike is a part of Griffith Park, but much less crowded than the park's more well-known trails. The land was privately owned for 60 years, but after a developer laid plans to construct luxury estates in 2009, there was a push by local groups to buy back the land with the help of some large donors. The area then became part of Griffith Park.
The trailhead starts at the end of Wonder View Drive. However, park alongside Lake Hollywood Drive because parking is not permitted on Wonder View.

[img501 fullwidth]

The path takes you along the ridge to Cahuenga Peak. The terrain is a bit more rugged and steep, so I’d recommend only going when conditions are good. Round trip to the Wisdom Tree is around 3 miles – however, don’t let the short distance fool you. The hike is an 872-foot elevation gain and can be fairly strenuous. I was huffing and puffing my way up.
It was all worth it for the view at the top. The Wisdom Tree stands solo on the ridge, and the scenery overlooks all of Los Angeles. We decided to go at sunset, so were able to watch the sun sink into the ocean while we struggled for breath. The city lights and car headlights were sprinkled along the valley, and it looked so serene I almost forgot I was in a city.
Next to the Wisdom Tree, there’s a box filled with notes and letters of advice. One reads, ""Travel often."" Surrounding the tree are a variety of rock formations, each containing their own letters. Each slip of paper was a different piece of wisdom from an anonymous source.

[img502 fullwidth]

There’s also an American flag flying on top, opposite from the Wisdom Tree. You can see the flag flapping in the distance from the very start of the hike.
Overall this experience took me about two hours, and in that time period I think I gained much more knowledge than my nights in a library.
Nature > library. The end.

10,4,Glassware for Repair: Family business maintains art of glassblowing,glassware-repair-family-business-maintains-art-glassblowing,prime/winter-2014/lead/glassblowing.jpg,Jeff Tait is a glassblower who comes to UCLA about once a month to pick up and repair broken glassware from the chemistry department and around campus. ,"At the end of a corridor on the ground floor of Young Hall is Room 1294. If you peer through the bent, yellowing plastic shades and you’re lucky, you may see a man.

[img77 right]

His name is Jeff Tait. He is likely bent over a worktable that is shoved against a wall of the small anteroom leading into the electronics shop. He’ll be sketching a large spherical glass apparatus on a yellow pad of lined paper.

Tait is not always there – he comes in about once a month on no regular schedule. “It’s kind of a word-of-mouth type thing,” Tait said. “People ask around and find (me).”

Since 2002, Tait, CEO and head glassblower for T&G Scientific Glass Fabrication, Inc., has been repairing, designing and fabricating custom and standard glassware for the UCLA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.

Tait, who has been blowing glass for 42 years, may not have a background in chemistry, but he makes up for it in years of experience, having gradually picked up the language of chemistry from all of the projects he has worked on.

Craig Merlic, associate professor in the chemistry and biochemistry department, is the man who found Tait. Over the past 24 years, Merlic has witnessed changes within the department regarding glassblowing.

Before Tait, UCLA had three full-time, on-campus glassblowers. That was in the 1970s. By the 1980s, that number had dropped to two, and in the 1990s there was only one left, Merlic said. By 2002, UCLA had closed the on-campus glass shop where these glassblowers had worked and, in that same year, hired Tait to take care of UCLA’s glassware needs.

# The workshop

After picking up boxes of broken glass and consulting with various researchers at UCLA, Tait takes the materials to his workshop in Laguna Hills, where he will make the necessary repairs.

An Airstream Land Yacht travel trailer is parked inside the garage door that serves as the only major natural light source in the otherwise windowless warehouse. There’s a forklift in front of the trailer, and in the 20-foot space behind them are three sand buggies, a lawn mower, a motorcycle and hundreds of boxes either piled on the floor or stacked on shelving that extends to the ceiling.

To the left of these “ongoing projects” are the machines relevant to the glassblowing trade. Ovens that reach roughly 1,020 degrees Fahrenheit and two lathes that hold and spin glass while fire melts the pieces together are just some of the components necessary to get the job done.

This is where broken glassware gets its second chance at life.

Sitting at one of the lathes, Tait works to seal a neck onto a flask. Wearing square, black glasses and holding a flame torch, he directs a bright orange fireball at the point he wants to seal.

[img81 fullwidth]

The fireball engulfs a good portion of the neck he’s trying to attach to the flask, making it hard to tell what the glass looks like at all. The trick is the eyewear. The specialized lenses cause the distracting fireball, called a sodium flare, to become almost invisible to Tait. Instead, all he sees is the true shape of the glass.

[img79 fullwidth]

He finishes the piece, removing it from the lathe with his bare hands and placing it in the oven.

“It doesn’t hurt, but you dance a little,” Tait said, rubbing his fingers together.

The carpet beneath him is sprinkled with black burn marks.

There is a distinction that researchers who work with glassware make before they approach Tait: whether an object can be thrown away or not.

It all comes down to the cost of a broken object. A glass quartz tube with the capacity to withstand high temperatures could cost upward of $400 to replace but might be cheaper to repair. An equivalent tube made of different material without that tolerance for heat might cost $50 to $60 to replace, Tait said. At that price, some might choose to buy a new tube.

The industry has become mechanized, he said. Rather than repair glass, oftentimes it’s less costly to throw it away. That means specialty glasswork, like the customization T&G offers, is more of a niche market, and work often depends on how cost-effective the company is for a customer.

Tait’s visits to UCLA are so irregular that some, like Ryan Chung, a third-year chemistry student, have turned to other options. Chung, who was part of a synthetic inorganic research group, said that inexpensive glass that was broken in the lab was just thrown away. Anything more expensive and worthy of repair was outsourced to shops in Pasadena.

# A family business

[img80 right]

“Dad, how old are you?” shouts Wesley Tait, 34, son of Jeff Tait and vice president in charge of production at T&G. He throws a ball for his dog Mookie, who scrambles away to retrieve it in the cluttered workshop.

There’s a pause before the older Tait, who is working on another piece at the glass lathe, replies.

“Too old.”

Jeff Tait is 59.

After graduating high school, he attended Orange Coast College for about six months before dropping out.

In 1972, he ended up in the warehouse of a now-out-of-business glass manufacturing company near Costa Mesa. He worked there, moving up in the ranks, until 1985, when he started T&G with a friend.

The company is now family-owned – his wife, son and daughter work there together. As for his clients, he remembers most, if not all, as well as the work he did for them. He said he’s been in business with most of his clients since he opened his shop 25 years ago. He still prefers delivering glass by hand because the packaging is easier and he gets to see his customers, he said. He calls these trips his “Tour de California.”

[img78 left]

Leaning against the Airstream, Jeff Tait recounts a story of a client in Las Vegas who called one day at 7 a.m. requesting at least a dozen 14-foot-long probes by the next day to be used for environmental testing.

“It was just a matter of sealing tubes,” Jeff Tait said.

They were on the road to Las Vegas by 4 p.m. that day. The tubes stretched from the dashboard of his truck to 3 or 4 feet out the back, with the bike rack acting as support.

After telling his story, Jeff Tait walks away to get more work done, while Wesley Tait holds a ball for Mookie and talks about a day in the life at the workshop.

His mom hasn’t been around lately, so the workshop is messier than usual, he said, laughing. And his sister, who deals with the finances, has been out on maternity leave. Lately, it has just been his dad and him, working side by side on different projects for hours each day.

The best part of it all?

He first consults his companion for feedback: “What do you think, Mookie?” Then he throws a ball toward a file cabinet.

“It’s always changing,” he said. “I could do one part 100 times and every time it would seal differently.”",5,""

He led a platoon of 30 men for the British Army in Iraq.","[img83 fullwidth]

Colored flags mark six continents and obscure most of Europe on the large canvas map that overlooks the living room of a neat two-bedroom apartment just more than two miles from the UCLA campus.

After four years as an officer in the British Army, Oliver Kay ventured to a new city, Los Angeles, to get his education. He graduated with recognition for excellence in service from UCLA in September, and commissioned as a military intelligence officer, this time under a different flag.

Now a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Kay began his military career anew as a cadet in UCLA’s U.S. Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.

[img85 left]

“I just wanted to serve my country,” Kay said, after pointing out the area of the South China Sea where his grandfather – his inspiration for joining the military – served.“It sounds very cheesy, but to me, it’s very deep, I actually really mean it.”

Kay, now 32, still remembers his first day in Iraq in 2008. The large doors of the carrier plane opened, a sandy desert lay ahead of him, and he began his tour with a platoon of British soldiers who would soon become a group he would call his family.

“I remember getting out of the Hercules, as soon as the door dropped down and the smell just wafted in, a distinctive heat just hit me.”

The unfamiliarity of the territory coupled with the uneasiness of not knowing what lay beyond the wire fencing surrounding their base could have made Kay yearn for home. But he relished the opportunity and made the best of his circumstances.

Today, Kay remembers the day he handed his platoon of 30 men over to the commander who took his place as one of the most difficult moments in his life.

“It was more difficult than saying goodbye to my family, because I had been a soldier with them for two years.

I knew them better than I knew my sisters.”

***

In 2009, Kay’s then-wife asked him to move to Los Angeles from England. She missed her homeland and wanted to return, promising she would help him find an Arabic program and enroll at a university to finally earn his undergraduate degree.

Together they moved to Los Angeles and he began studying at California State University, Northridge. After one year, Kay transferred to UCLA, where he studied African and Middle Eastern studies.

With four years of service as an officer in the British Army, Kay hoped to return to the armed services. As a student at UCLA, this meant enrolling as a cadet in the ROTC program.

The transition from platoon commander to cadet was a rocky one at first. Despite his previous and extensive military experience, Kay had to start from the bottom in the U.S. Army. Every nation has different training requirements, and career experience in a foreign military doesn’t transfer over as it might for other careers.

Entering college ROTC programs with previous U.S. military experience isn’t unheard of. Typically, an enlisted member of the military goes to college and joins the ROTC with the hope of rejoining the military as a commissioned officer after graduation.

But entering the training program with foreign military experience is less common.

“Basic training was a very frustrating experience. I went from being second in command to being a private,” Kay said.

[img82 right]

His peers were no longer experienced war veterans. His fellow cadets mostly consisted of teenage college students just beginning to learn military skills and traditions. Students in the program, often fresh from high school, ranked higher than him in the program and had never seen active duty.

“You learn more in two months of operations than two years of training,” he said.

Despite initial frustrations, Kay’s months on tour in Iraq proved useful for his fellow cadets when the same tactics he learned became new lessons in training exercises on campus.

“He shared from his experiences of leadership,” said Lt. Col. Michael McDermott, a professor and chair of the UCLA Department of Military Science, which is synonymous with the ROTC program. McDermott, who joined the department last summer, was impressed by Kay’s gregarious and engaging personality, which helped other cadets understand leadership as a partnership.

During Kay’s time at UCLA, ROTC students learned tactical skills on the grassy fields at Sunset Canyon Recreation Center every Thursday. On one occasion, Kay helped teach cadets to clear buildings, a skill he developed and used during his tour in Iraq.

Most of the training for warfare in Iraq involves fighting in cities, Kay said. To prepare soldiers for these conditions, the military teaches Military Operations in Urban Terrain, a strategy that allows soldiers to clear potentially dangerous buildings.

In populous urban neighborhoods, enemy combatants are rarely in the open, but rather hidden in buildings, out of sight, making it important for soldiers to effectively clear a building for safe passage.

“Like a baby, you learn to crawl, then walk, run, sprint,” Kay said. “It’s the same in the military.”

He helped them learn slowly, to first clear one room, then two. Next they would practice what it would be like to clear a building with two rooms and an upper story. Kay said opportunities to act as both pupil and informal instructor made working his way up from the bottom less discouraging.

Buildings were an obstacle Kay was familiar with, but academic life provided a new challenge.

Victoria Sanelli, the department manager for UCLA’s military science department, helped Kay adjust to the ROTC program and life at UCLA. Subjects like mathematics, which weren’t Kay’s strong suit, posed a challenge, Sanelli said.

“He has really worked so hard to come to UCLA, graduate and commission,” Sanelli said. “There were a lot of things that would have been easy to lose conviction over, but he kept trying and didn’t give up.”

***

A photo of Kay’s company in the British Army is tacked to a wall above his bed. On the back, the phrase “Cheers Rambo, it’s been emotional,” was scrawled by fellow soldier Prince Harry of Wales.

Nearby, on a wooden table, stands a tall, white candle, which the British Army gave to him when he first deployed to Iraq. The candle will sit on his bedside table until it is burned at his funeral.

“A lot of civilians don’t understand what it’s like when you’re actually in war,” he said. “And at the same time, soldiers shouldn’t expect them to. What I personally felt as a veteran, was (that) it just was nice to come back and just to talk to people.”

[img84 right]

But among all his sentimental belongings, the quiet fish tank swimming with bright red and blue cardinal tetra stands out.

“I find them really relaxing and sometimes I’ll just sit here with a cup of tea for ages. And I’ll just watch my fish.”

Kay was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his service in Iraq. When he first returned, he said he would feel sad. When he would feel overwhelmed, Kay would take a quiet moment to think about his fish or go for a run on the beach.

During the three years he attended UCLA, Kay ran the L.A. Marathon to collect donations for veterans. Running was both a way to give back and a way to find peace. Last year, the UCLA Department of Military Science gave Kay the prestigious Mark Daily Selfless Service Award for his work raising money for veterans, his volunteer work and his efforts to help other cadets.

The Daily Award, given every year to a member of the graduating cadet class who shows the most dedication to service, was created to honor a UCLA ROTC alumnus who was killed in service on a tour in Iraq.

***

Sunrise and sunset are Kay’s favorite times of day. While he was at UCLA, he made a habit of running at Drake Stadium and watching the sun rise over Westwood.

“I was never upset to be there,” he said.

On Dec. 14, Kay officially commissioned as a military intelligence officer in the Army Reserve. Since graduating in September, he found a job working at Control Risks, a company that offers security services, where his military experience serves him well in analyzing security risks in different parts of the world.

But even after leaving campus, Kay’s habits have stuck with him.

These days, he ventures out to Santa Monica to run on the hard sand that touches the edge of the ocean. When the sun begins to set, he sometimes stops running and sits to watch the sinking light meet the dark water.

Here, he finds another quiet moment.",1,""
12,4,A perfect day in LA: Around Downtown Los Angeles,perfect-day-la-around-downtown-los-angeles,prime/winter-2014/lead/perfectdayinla_1.jpg,"Spend a day in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, taking in the sights and eating good food. ","[img127 fullwidth]

[img86 right]

Enter the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, where gritty industrial buildings meet contemporary craftsmanship in a creative hub that has maintained its artistic soul since the ‘80s. Loud art lines the streets of this ever-growing contemporary community, and an array of museums, boutiques, cafes and gourmet eateries can be found at every corner.

Start your day in the Arts District with a visit to Angels Flight Railway on Bunker Hill – an L.A. monument named “The Shortest Railway in the World.” Next, pass through downtown Los Angeles’ historic core, notice Central Library’s stunning cathedral architecture. As you make your way around a plethora of murals in the district, follow the painted black hearts to The Pie Hole, where mouthwatering Mexican chocolate and Earl Grey tea pies await.

Just around the corner sit contemporary home goods stores – such as Poketo and Apolis – that will appeal to anyone with a love for stationary, crafts and decor. After you’ve cast a yearning gaze over the designs, head over to Eat.Drink.Americano, an affordable gastropub with industrial brick walls, plush couches and the best flatbreads in town. End your night in the Arts District ,browsing the installations at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Admission is free every Thursday from 5-8 p.m., so plan accordingly.

[img92 left]

Walk past the artist murals into an old ivy-covered brick building, and you have entered Eat.Drink.Americano, a gastropub located in the heart of the Arts District.

The first thing you’ll notice? The seamless combination of historic- meets-contemporary aesthetic that is reflective of the downtown spirit. High ceilings, wood beams and arched windows abound. The bar stools? Recycled. The communal tables? Made using reclaimed wood from just down the street. And the eye-catching chalkboard wall that hangs from ceiling to floor?

This is the work of artist Peter Greco, dubbed “Lord of the Letter” for his typography skills, who hand-finished the mural in no less than 10 weeks.

Mingling with guests and overseeing it all is restaurant owner Michael Burke, who founded Americano in 1998 alongside his partner, Angie.

“Greco’s work is a reflection of everything Americano encompasses as a restaurant – our utilization of the skilled art community, our commitment to local artisans and craftsmakers, and our overarching appreciation for organic farm produce that is domestic and sustainable,” Burke said.

[img93 fullwidth]

[img88 right]

Originally from the UK, Burke has a keen vision of the internationally influenced, locally produced flavors he puts on the menu.

“We’ll tell you where the produce originated and the background of the farm, distillery or brewery where it was produced,” Burke said.

Equally important to Burke are the relationships he wishes to foster through the community, and he frequents nearby local businesses such as the Bread Lounge, Stumptown Coffee Roasters and various farmers mar- kets in Los Angeles.

While lunches are more in the style of a New York deli, for dinner Burke suggests ordering a variety of dishes such as the meat and cheese charcuterie boards with artisan breads, the braised oxtail sliders or steak tartare with mustard ice cream.

Americano’s New-York style pastrami flatbread with mozzarella and shiitake mushroom, topped with fresh basil, is a classic. And the amaretto-soaked tiramisu is one dessert you do not want to miss.

[img89 left]

As the late afternoon crowd winded down, Burke reflected upon the source of energy that has created the casual, fun spirit of Americano today.

“This area has always been a destination for creative people. Like the meatpacking district in New York City, in the ‘80s and ‘90s artists came for affordable housing, so it has always had that artistic flair. It’s been influenced by a lot of cultures – nearby Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Boyle Heights; it’s a melting pot of cultures. From a workforce perspective, there are lots of creative types in fashion and jewelry but also just white-collar workers too. The artist district is unique in itself. It is continually changing, just like art is.”

How did a charming, simple wallet lead to a global destination for artists and admirers alike? Poketo, an art-decor gallery store founded in 2003 by husband-and-wife duo Angie Myung and Ted Vadakan, stemmed from a desire to create affordable but high-quality design pieces from artists all over the world.

[img94 fullwidth]

Through this concept, the couple began working with various artists to design handcrafted wallets that include a short bio, story and pen as well as contact info.

“We wanted to make something that can travel with you anywhere, as if we’re taking the art off the gallery walls and making it more accessible. We collaborate with artists all over the world, and when we find an item we really like with a story behind it, we’ll work with anyone,” Myung said.

[img90 fullwidth]

Flash forward to 2014, and rows of printed stationary, colorful home goods, canvas backpacks and art magazines are only a few of the distinctly crafted pieces that line the walls of Poketo. As the team’s creative director, Myung cites her grandmother as a main inspiration and the reason behind the store’s name.

[img87 left]

“My grandmother is really dear to my heart and she would always mispronounce certain words like cup (“coppu”) and pocket (“poketo”), and the name just stuck,” she recalled with a smile.

With a 52-piece homeware capsule collection designed for Target under its belt, Poketo is now focused on in-store workshops such as leather-crafting, floral-arranging and calligraphy.

“Handwriting is such a lost art,” Myung mused. The couple is also busy with the opening of the newest branch of Poketo at The Line Hotel in Koreatown. Looks like a visit downtown to these creative spirits is in order.

It is almost a tradition that every marine biology class ends with a depressing lecture on overfishing and the tragic future of the ocean.

“Traditionally, we viewed the sea as a super abundant resource,” said Patricia Halpin, a UCLA marine biology professor. “Now we are coming to an era where (human) population and food pressure are huge, and our ability to harvest resources from the ocean is enormous. Then we realize that (the ocean) is not infinitely exploitable, and it does have to be managed conservatively.”

Some scientific studies predict that by 2114 wild fish stock will be decimated, others say as early as 2048.

But all is not yet lost. You can do your part by eating seafood fished sustainably – that means reducing your consumption of overfished species and supporting fishing methods that have long-term ocean health in mind. Using the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch as a guideline for what’s in danger and what’s not, we went in search of delicious and sustainable seafood in Los Angeles.

# “The $1 Oyster Bar”
## Green Hut Cafe
### 808 W, 7th St., Los Angeles, CA 90017

[img103 fullwidth]

[img96 right]

How many times have you skipped the raw oysters on a seafood restaurant’s menu just because you are trying to save up for next quarter’s textbooks or this weekend’s beer? Raw oysters at Green Hut Cafe are fresh and delicious – and come at an affordable price.

Located on a busy street in downtown, the restaurant has a woody interior that juxtaposes against the concrete appearance of the old city, like a wooden dock connecting two different worlds.

The oyster bar is directly across a long table at the inner end of the res- taurant. If you’re not sure about which kind of oyster you prefer after reading the menu, you can walk across to see the osyters behind glass, labeled with their origin, taste and texture.

We recommend the Eastern oysters, harvested from Delaware and Chesapeake, Va., which are $1 each during happy hour. Although frozen in ice, the meat is soaked in a puddle of brine and looks plump and hearty. The silvery inner lining of the shell reflects the light that falls on it, glittering through the seawater. The oyster meat tastes mellow and firm. Add a few drops of fresh lemon as a final touch. Cheers (slurp)!

[img104 fullwidth]

Oysters are usually farmed hanging inside a mesh bag in the water, with minimal impact on the marine environment. They feed by filtering out micro-organisms or particles in the seawater, directly improving local water quality. Therefore, oyster farming does not directly harm wild fish populations, making it more ocean-friendly and sustainable.

# ""The East Coast Dream”
## Wink’s Lobster & Seafood
### 1800 Avenue of the Stars Los Angeles, CA 90067

[img105 fullwidth]

It is almost magical that such layered flavor in a Maine lobster roll can be found in a compact booth in a farmers market in Los Angeles. Amid a busy farmers market, Wink’s Lobster & Seafood is easily recognizable, with a road sign showing a silhouette of a lobster colored in red.

Brandon Winkler, the business owner, grew up in Casco, Maine.

[img98 left]

“As a kid, we eat lobsters there a few times a week to the point we get sick of it,” he said. Two years ago, he left the finance world and started the lobster roll business.

He pulls out a beige stick of bread, coats each side with a smear of liquid butter and begins to toast it on a pan. “This style of bread is the New England split roll,” he said. “There was only so many bakers who make this on the East Coast and they don’t make it out here (in California).” Eventually, he met a baker who was willing to bake this style of bread exclusively for him.

The golden New England split-top roll purses tightly around the tender lobster meat from Rockland, Maine, vibrantly colored with a naturally pastel red and orange. Although coated with butter, the lobster roll is not even slightly oily. Despite traveling across the country, the lobster still delivers a hint of the virgin taste of the briny ocean in every single bite. According to Seafood Watch, lobster from this area is a more sustainable option than some lobsters caught in other areas.

[img99 fullwidth]

“(My family and I) went out for dinner in a lobster restaurant a few years ago,” Winkler said. “I had all of these memories coming back to me, like the good times I had in Maine. This (business) is a way for me to connect back to the memories from my childhood. It’s like a dream.”

Whenever you get tired of the shenanigans in Los Angeles, Wink’s Lobster & Seafood is just the perfect place for a bit of Northeast culture.

# “An Ambassador of Seafood Sustainability”
## Santa Monica Seafood
### 1000 Wilshire Blvd. Santa Monica, CA 90401

[img95 fullwidth]

A family tradition and an ocean-friendly fish market, Santa Monica Seafood is a great place to stop for your catch of the day.

Founded in 1939 on the Santa Monica Pier, the restaurant moved to the Wilshire location four years ago, said Christopher Wade, the general manager.

[img100 left]

The retail market occupies more than half the restaurant space. Scottish salmon, Alaska halibut, cherrystone clams, New Zealand snapper – you name it – lay neatly behind a glass window labeled with its origin and fishing practice (i.e. wild-caught, natural farm or cultured).

On the right side of the store entrance, cafe tables face Wilshire Boulevard.

A bowl of steamed littleneck clams served with grilled ciabatta is a great dish to start. Each clam is the size of a pingpong ball and sits in a hot winey broth cooked with tomatoes, garlic and onions. The dish is sprinkled with cilantro and scallions, and the clams are chewy and soaked with the essence of the soup. If you’re 21, they go well with a nice glass of wine and a sunny day.

[img101 right]

The smoky swordfish sandwich ($17), our sandwich recommendation, is packed with red onions, tomatoes, arugula and a piece of swordfish covered with chipotle aioli sauce inside two lightly toasted sourdough slices. It is served with a spring mix salad and drizzled with olive oil. The swordfish has the texture of chicken meat, but a bit flakier. The spiciness of the aioli sauce is balanced by the hint of bitterness from the arugula.

“Our buyers are very conscious about where the fishes are coming from,” Wade said. “When Seafood Watch says fish population is dropping below a certain level, we tend not to carry it.”

Sustainable seafood is only possible because consumers and producers work together as a team. Your choice of seafood makes a difference.",6,""

For UCLA students, moving out of the dorms and into nearby off-campus apartments is a rite of passage. And while many students may view their college apartment as merely temporary housing, for others, creating a custom-decorated space turns a rental into a home.

But finding stylish decor can be a challenge on a student budget, with many students turning to do-it-yourself projects to cultivate an individualized space.

prime asked two students to show us their creatively styled apartments, offer tips and tricks and share what inspires them about design.

Come through the door and take a look inside.

***

Alec Moore, 22
Fourth-year art history student
Hometown: Irvine
Type of apartment: studio

**prime:** What is your biggest design influence or inspiration?

**Alec Moore:** That’s a difficult question. I think that the real impetus of design is just not wanting to live in squalor. Dissatisfaction with your surroundings, really.

**prime:** Many of the items in your apartment are either rehabilitated furniture or DIY. Can you explain how you go about finding pieces to fix or improve?


**AM:** There’s actually a funny story about me finding derelict furniture. That’s really what I try and go for when I’m walking through the streets of Westwood. I try and pay attention more to the form of a piece than the color or the state it’s in – that can always be fixed.

But I was actually walking to campus one day, and I was over by Broad (Art Center) when I saw this fabulous piece of furniture just left out. And I thought “Oh my god, I have to have it, it’s beautiful.” It was this little footstool ottoman with claw-foot legs, and I took it. Little did I know, I had inadvertently stolen a sculpture student’s final and he was having a critique that day. So I had to run it back to campus or be arrested.

**prime:** Speaking of DIY furniture, you rehabilitated the settee in you're living room. What’s the story behind that?

**AM:** Well, it cost $8,000 and I got it from Restoration Hardware. No, I’m kidding. A friend and I found it in an alleyway behind Yamato. It was missing a leg, and it was brown with hideous upholstery.

I knew I wanted it to be white wood, and I knew the upholstery had to be changed. So I decided to tackle it myself. I took all the fabric off, undid the staples and glue and I stained the fabric blue. Then, before I put it back on the frame, I spray-painted the wood white. I also spray-painted my wicker chairs and redid their seats – they were brown before.

**prime:** You have a large painting above your bed, what’s the story behind that?

**AM:** That is ""(Mrs.) Sarah Siddons"" by Thomas Gainsborough from 1785. She was the first really renowned female actress, and she really paved the way for making acting a suitable profession for women.

**prime:** Do you have a favorite piece in the apartment?

**AM:** My favorite piece is probably the bust of Louis (XIV, king of France). I bought Louis in the Louvre (Museum) gift shop several years ago and had him shipped back. And he arrived just smashed to hell and back. And so I spent the entire summer between freshman and sophomore year just gluing the pieces back together.

**prime:** What do you think makes good design?

**AM:** Having good taste.

**prime:** Parting advice for aspiring apartment decorators?

**AM:** Design is so important. It isn’t about being easy. Nothing about cultivating a space is easy. Ugly beige box apartments are easy. You just have to find things yourself and make them what you want them to be.

Sarah Summers, 21
Third-year dance student
Hometown: Sonoma
Type of apartment: two-bedroom

**prime:** What would you say is your favorite thing about interior design?


**Sarah Summers:** I think my room has always been a place where I made things. Whether it’s songwriting or making art, I’ve always been a very project-based person. And so it’s more inspiring and easier to get work done if I’m in a space that cultivates that creativity. For me it’s all about setting the stage for a place where I can actually get stuff done.

**prime:** A lot of your stuff is DIY and has a personal touch. Is there something in particular that draws you to creating your own decor?


**SS:** I think it’s very much a product of how I grew up. My mom worked for a short time as a children’s furniture painter, and so she would go and find old, sort of decrepit tables and dressers and would bring them back to life with paint or gold leaf or even decoupage.

I think part of it comes from my family really liking nice things but not necessarily having a lot of money to go out and buy nice things. I think it builds a little more of an authentic space if you’re building things on your own. Anybody can go out and see something nice and just buy it, and sometimes that’s nice. But it’s not nearly as satisfying as knowing the things in your house are a part of you.

**prime:** Do you have a particular aesthetic style you feel most inspired by?

**SS:** I like clash, but I also like things that are practical. I really like finding ways to tie mismatched, individual pieces together. My first instinct in decorating this place was just to get as much color as possible – we don’t really have a color theme here. But I also like things to be very functional and easy to clean. I feel like that really filters into my style because I don’t like surfaces with lots of cluttered things on them because it’s not as easy to dust.

**prime:** Do you have any tricks or tips for students trying to create a very warm and custom look within a reasonable budget range?


**SS:** I think, honestly, the first thing that you need to learn if you’re interested in home decorating is just basic cleaning skills. Because so many people in college don’t have those, and that prevents them from caring about their space because it’s hard. And it’s so transient here that people come and go through apartments and leave grime.

And it’s much easier to be inspired to decorate a place that smells nice and doesn’t have weird dust. Cleaning is the first thing to do, and it’s cheap, but it requires a lot of love and labor. And then I think just learning to see things as potential decorating utilities – like I use tickets from places I’ve been and flyers from shows that I’ve been to. On their own, it looks like something to throw away. But when you keep them and collect them, you can hang a whole wall full of memories. I think it’s often just hard for students to find the time.


**prime:** What inspires you when you decorate?

**SS:** I think it becomes easier and more exciting for me to decorate when I think about other people being here. It becomes exciting and fun when it’s about people and it’s not just about making things pretty or having nice things. When it’s about making a space where people can come over and feel warm and welcome and happy, that’s what makes me excited about design. It’s really all about people and having a good time.",18,""
113,13,prime City Guide: Joshua Tree,prime-city-guide-joshua-tree,prime/fall-2016/lead/web.pr.joshuatree.Hayley.jpg,"","## Hiking
[img505 fullwidth] 

My family and I are avid backpackers and hikers. When I first went to Joshua Tree National Park, I was dead set on trekking through its backcountry. But since it is a desert in Southern California with remote access to water, we settled for day hikes and staying at the campsites in the national park. We only had a short 24 hours down there, but we were determined to make the best of it.

We arrived late on a Friday night, by which time all of the campsites had been filled. We followed the directions to overflow camping, which took us to a random patch of shrubs, not far from the freeway. The headlights and occasional blare of a horn kept me grounded as I drifted off staring into the starry night.

The next day, we went by the Oasis Visitor Center in the north of the park to prepare for our day. We decided to tackle the Lost Palms Oasis and Mastodon Peak – a hike approximately 7 miles long, round trip. It took us roughly three hours to complete at a leisurely pace. The trail is located in the south of the park, isolated from many of the other hiking and climbing areas, so there weren’t as many people.

The hike starts in a dry area just like the rest of Joshua Tree, but slowly transforms into a tranquil green patch of various flora and fauna. The path runs alongside an old waterway that ends in a damp, marsh-like area, which I assumed was once a water hole. The trail ends at the Lost Palms Oasis. Located at the bottom of a valley, the oasis consists of larger-than-life palm trees and plenty of tabletop rocks. In our opinion, the perfect place for a picnic.
We headed back from the hike just around 1 p.m. Although we were low on water, we were still thirsty for more dirt trails in Joshua Tree. We got back to our car around 2:30 p.m. and decided to hike to the top of Ryan Mountain before exiting the park.

Ryan Mountain is in the center of the park and is one of its biggest attractions. Although the round trip is only 3 miles, getting to the top requires more than 1,000 feet in elevation gain – do not underestimate this hike. Bring plenty of water as it gets hotter the higher you go.

At the top, alongside the stunning backdrop of Joshua Tree, is a pile of rocks with the sign ""Ryan Mountain, elevation: 5,457 feet."" Conquering that was our last feat of the weekend as it was time to head back. We trudged down the mountain as the sun was starting to fall, along with the temperature.
We had a long drive from the dream that is Joshua Tree, back to the reality we face in Los Angeles.

## Town

[img507 fullwidth]
Joshua Tree National Park is one of nine national parks located in California. I’m all for the great outdoors, but for my day trip, I chose going into town over hiking on top of humongous rock formations – otherwise known as rock climbing.

I trip enough over flat sidewalk as is.

A few friends and I drove into Twentynine Palms from our Airbnb house in the park, with the air conditioner blasting. A sign off the single-lane freeway called our name: Cactus Mart.

Admittedly, I should have been happy with the native cacti I was surrounded by in a desert; however, I wanted tiny succulents for my dorm room, and it is against the law to uproot plants from a national park.

[img503 fullwidth]

We parked and were instantly greeted by some of the friendliest small-town store owners I have ever met. They learned about our long journey from Los Angeles and gave us a tour of the store before instructing us on do-it-yourself potting techniques and plant care.

After watching us struggle, one of the employees laughed and took up a spade to join us in “getting our hands dirty,” as we attempted to shove cacti into tiny pots and not crush them in the process. Clearly not in Los Angeles anymore, each succulent cost $1.

We exchanged goodbyes and were told to honk on our way out of town.

Continuing our tour of the three-block downtown, my friends and I visited a few thrift stores and vintage shops. In Pioneer Crossing Antiques, I tried on a puffy dress from the ’40s that made me look like a possessed prom queen.

At this point, we’d worked up an appetite and I was treated to my first-ever trip to Sonic Drive-In, roller skates and all.

As the sun set, we happily drove back to the Airbnb house, our hands and laps full of french fries, shakes and drought-tolerant plants.

A day later, we drove past the Cactus Mart on our way back to Los Angeles, and remembered to honk. We shrieked happily as we saw our new friends run to the roadside to wish us off, waving and cheering as they shrunk to specks in the desert.

## Climbing

[img504 fullwidth]

Joshua Tree National Park is a gem for anyone who wants to sunbathe on rocks like a lizard, boulder through cracks and up the ledges to get a new perspective of the heavens or just relax and camp out amid a desert escape. It has held a special place in my heart ever since my parents, who were married there, took my sister and me camping as kids and let us explore the rocks and climb over small boulders. 

Today the landscape still stretches as far as the eye can see; hills of granite still spread over the sandy world in a plethora of formations and shapes. They give fans of bouldering and rock climbing gleams in their eyes. I love bouldering on the rock heaps in Indian Cove Campground, and on a recent trip, I found the perfect wall.

[img508 fullwidth]

The amazing traction of the granite texture gave my hands and feet fluidity in movement as I crouched, jumped and slipped from rock to rock. As my arms reached for each handhold, I watched the ground grow farther and farther away. I climbed in early morning on the shaded side of the rock, so as I approached the summit, rays of light bled over my climbing path. Bright orange and yellow lights contrasted brilliantly with dark shadowy rocks. Once I reached the top I didn’t yell out in victory. I didn’t take a panoramic photo with my camera. I just stood there and looked all around.

I love Joshua Tree for the private peace and solitude you can easily find among the rocks. This scene, this moment was mine and mine alone. It was a few minutes of surreal beauty and peace that solely belonged to my vantage point. Even for just a weekend, moments like these help me hit pause on my constantly stressful and busy life and feel like I’m in an alternative universe. This reason is perhaps why more and more rock climbers and yogis are moving out here – to freeze time and find themselves.

The scenery seems straight from a movie or some distant wild paradise but in reality, Joshua Tree rests about three and a half hours east of Los Angeles, making it the perfect city escape.",57,""

Alexis Williams, 21, fourth-year history student

**Hometown?**

Brentwood.

**Why study history?**

I get really worked up when I think about the past. I major in storytelling, really.

**What inspires your style?**

I really like to find things that look nice. I don’t have a really defined style. I like to find things that are comfortable.

**Where do you like to buy clothes?**

Mostly secondhand stores, where things don’t really all look the same. And they’re old – I like old things.

**What’s your favorite place on UCLA’s campus?**

I don’t spend much time on campus, but probably Kerckhoff.

**You’re both a commuter and a transfer student. What are some of the challenges that brings?**

I guess mostly it’s that I’m not really part of Bruin life. Most of my friends don’t go here; I've never lived near campus – I’m just very removed. This is my first year here, and I’m not really in the community.

**What do you think of student style on campus?**

[img366 fullwidth]

Eh. Everyone is in workout clothes or looks like a 12-year-old who lives at Brandy Melville.

**One piece of style advice to give students?**

Don’t try so hard.

**Where did you get your:**

**Pants?** They’re Guess, and I got them from the Fairfax swap meet.

**Shoes?** Doc Martens, from Wasteland.

**Socks?** Men’s socks from Target.

**Top?** American Apparel (I get half off because my friend works there).

**Sweater?** Also from the Fairfax swap meet.

**Rings?** One my mom bought me from a Native American store, and the other one is my great-grandpa’s, he was a Freemason. This was the least gaudy of the rings that he had.

**Necklaces?** The purple one is my friend Anya’s. She’s studying abroad for a year, so I wear it to remind myself of her. The other one is my grandpa’s, and it’s a St. Christopher medal that his high-school girlfriend gave him, so the back of it is inscribed.

Julie Edwards, 22, fourth-year geography/environmental studies student

**Hometown?**

Santa Monica.

**How tall are you?**

Six foot.

**Do you always wear your pants cuffed?**

We both do, actually. No matter what, my pants always hit my ankles at an awkward length, so it’s just easier to have them rolled up.

**Favorite campus coffee shop?**

The SEAS Cafe, in Boelter, with the 99-cent drip coffee.

**Why study geography?**

Especially here, studying geography is really about learning how the world works. I like nature, and we don’t utilize the world in an effective or sustainable way, and studying that really interests me.

[img367 fullwidth]

**How would you describe your style?**


I like simple things because you can throw them together really easily. Clothes that are trendless, in a way. I like normal-looking clothes that have a slight twist on them.

**What do you think of student style on campus?**

In terms of L.A. style, being from here and growing up here, I think the style students have is okay. I think that people here care about their appearance a lot, instead of having fun with the stuff they wear and exploring things they might like. There’s a lot of focus on fitting in with everyone else. But we’re here to go to school; it’s not a runway. People can and should do as they please.

**What’s your favorite place on UCLA’s campus?**

I really like Engineering IV, because it’s like a labyrinth. You get lost – it’s creepy, there’s a hidden courtyard that no one ever goes to, and it’s just this maze of a building. I like that about it.

**As a graduating senior, looking back, do you feel you’ve been part of the UCLA community?**

It’s such a big school. I think that you can always find your little thing that you go to, your activity or group. But it’s not like there’s really a sense of community here at UCLA. There’s no way that we all come together, because there’s just so many people that go to school here that it would be impossible.


**Where did you get your:**

**Shoes?** Birkenstocks.

**Pants?** Gap – shoutout to Gap because they have tall sizes, and I like the material they use because it’s thick but still stretches.

**Shirt?** ASOS.

**Watch?** My dad got it for me. He’s really into tinkering with stuff, so I actually think he made it himself – like he bought the parts and put it together.

**Sweater?** It’s my dad’s, but it doesn’t fit him so he gave it to me. But it’s Hermès, so I’m very protective of it because it’s the one nice thing I own. I think it’s from the '70s.",10,""

These past nine months have been a roller coaster of emotions, from periods of intense stress during the peak of prime's production cycle to the deceptive calm after each issue hit newsstands. Like everyone else at the Daily Bruin, we're students too. School, jobs and extracurricular activities got in the way more times than we would have liked, but in the end, we all worked through it.

This quarter, we wanted to finish our term as editors on a strong note. Flip through prime's pages, and you'll find a close encounter with the Syrian refugee crisis as well as deeply personal stories about experiencing grief and depression. We explore technology in two ways: through the gender gap in computer science and an under-the-radar lab with a different approach to artificial intelligence. We also touch on the controversial history of one culture's ""comfort women"" and a student group's attempt to address it. Finally, we show you the best of Culver City as well as how to make Ukrainian Easter eggs and strawberries-and-cream scones with a hint of home.

Thank you for coming on this journey with us. We hope you'll continue to carry these stories with you during your time at UCLA and beyond.

Going to the movies is at once a communal and personal experience.

There is the cackling of the audience during a comedy and the collective gasp at a spine-chilling moment during a horror film. The motley crew of strangers in the drafty, dark auditorium becomes a united congregation – all along for the ride.

But there is also the pleasure of sinking into a plush movie seat that is yours for the next two hours. The intimate connection to the protagonist’s struggle, the utter captivation by plot twists and the savory, nostalgic smell of popcorn makes the vast theater feel like a private dinner with an old friend.

Los Angeles has been the motion picture epicenter for more than a century. Aspiring artists from across the world flock to the hills of Hollywood in hopes of eventually seeing their name on a marquee light.

Movie palaces across the city brought these artists’ work to the townspeople in a magical community space. A space whose existence has been threatened since the first movie palaces opened in the beginning of the 20th century.

Theaters have always been one step behind, having to keep up with the world around them but never running quite fast enough.

Every new decade since the inception of movie palaces has brought new technology and media for the theater industry to compete with. Radio, television and Netflix have carried the best of entertainment into people’s living rooms and bedrooms.

As a result, people are not looking to leave their homes for entertainment in the way they once did.

""From the 1920s to the 1980s, people have been predicting the end of movie theaters,” said Ross Melnick, an assistant professor of film and media studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara and a UCLA alumnus. “The question now is, will movie theaters adapt, as they always have?”

The first theaters in Los Angeles were nickelodeons on Broadway Street in downtown Los Angeles, said Jonathan Kuntz, a film historian and lecturer at UCLA. That generation of movie palaces lasted through the 1920s, until the Great Depression, when the building of movie theaters came to a crashing halt during the 1930s. Many of these 1920s-era theaters still exist, even if they no longer serve their original purpose.

[img375 fullwidth]

“The first generation of picture palaces was on Broadway, then went to Hollywood, then scattered around L.A.,” Kuntz said.

In the 1940s and 1950s, neighborhood movie houses began sprouting around the city. Finally, in the 1970s, multiplexes opened up around town and in the San Fernando Valley, Kuntz added.

But in the early 21st century, during the recession, some movie theaters closed their doors for good.

It was, and still is, uncertain how long movie theaters will survive.

“I think there will always be a niche for them,” Kuntz said. “But there's no clear future for the movie industry.”

It seems the movie theater experience is something Angelenos – and people around the world – are reluctant to let go of. Wherever they go, theaters have made their mark.

*Westwood Village*

Westwood’s Regency Bruin Theatre and Regency Village Theatre are iconic, with a rich history of their own. The Spanish-style, 170-foot tower above the Village theater is an L.A. landmark. Though it still hosts the occasional premiere, the Village theater used to show weekly premieres for blockbuster hits, such as Will Smith’s “Independence Day.”

The Regency Village Theater became an anchor of the Village when it opened in 1931.

“It's one of the last original buildings in the Village still performing its original purpose from 84 years ago,” Melnick said.

Melnick recalls living in an apartment behind the theater in 1996 and seeing the lines for premieres stretch down Weyburn Avenue, as far as he could see, to In-N-Out Burger and beyond. He grew up on the East Coast, watching movies in shopping centers, so the Westwood neighborhood movie house was a refreshing change of pace for him.

The Regency Village Theatre, also known as the Fox Theatre, was the first of its kind in Westwood. Today, it is a prominent movie chain up and down the West Coast.

[img387 fullwidth]

Although the Fox and Bruin theaters have the greatest name recognition today, there were about nine theaters in the Village just a few years ago.

Theaters that have closed include the Mann Festival Theater, which took up residence on Lindbrook Drive in 1970, next door to what is now 800 Degrees Pizza. But the movie house closed in July 2009 during the recession. When the Festival theater originally opened, it replaced the Village’s first Ralphs location, which had been there since 1929.

Whole Foods Market on Gayley Avenue used to be the Mann Westwood 4 theater, which opened in 1975 and closed in 2002.

The Mann Plaza, a single-screen movie house, was located on Glendon Avenue, where the Palazzo Westwood development stands today.

The United Artists Westwood 4 theater was about two blocks south of Wilshire Boulevard before it was renovated to become a CVS pharmacy.

The Crest Theater, which still exists, is located on Westwood Boulevard, a block closer to the Hammer Museum, and shows mainly a mix of old films and operas.

Melnick said one of the greatest losses, though, was the Mann National Theatre, which used to be on Lindbrook Drive. It opened in March 1970, closed in April 2007, reopened less than a month later with a shorter-term lease and was finally razed to the ground in January 2008.

“Westwood suffered an irreparable loss when the National closed,” Melnick said. “It had a fantastic Brady-Bunch-meets-Art-Deco lobby. It was too bad because it was really the other premiere house in Westwood.”

*Greater Los Angeles*

The old feel of the 1920s movie palaces is still palpable on Broadway Street in downtown Los Angeles. Many theaters that were once the epicenter of glamour and glitz still line the street’s busy sidewalks, but they’ve been converted into concert venues or clothing shops.

A standout is the Los Angeles Theatre, one of Kuntz’s favorites.

“It represents so much of the early days of L.A. and movies,” he said. “It’s spectacular.”

Built in 1931 in baroque style, the theater was modeled after King Louis XIV’s Palace of Versailles. When Kuntz visited the palace in France and walked through the ornate Hall of Mirrors, he immediately noticed a connection to the pattern in the Los Angeles Theatre lobby.

The theater has preserved many of its original features, like its ""crying room,” on the mezzanine level where mothers could take their inconsolable infants without missing the film. Moreover, the theater’s original periscope still resides in the women’s restroom, so female patrons could keep watching the movie while they primped, Kuntz said. While the theater does not show movies any longer, it continues to host special events.

“The Los Angeles has a rather restrained facade, but inside, it overwhelms you in its replication of French Renaissance style,” Melnick said. “It takes your breath away.”

Another L.A. icon is The Cinefamily, located in the Fairfax District. It is housed in the former Silent Movie Theatre, which opened in 1942 and showed only silent movies.

[img376 fullwidth]

Though the lights haven’t gone out on the theater, it has a dark past.

In 1997, a theater projectionist named James Van Sickle paid a man $25,000 to kill the Silent Movie Theatre’s 74-year-old owner, Lawrence Austin. Austin had left his $1 million estate to Van Sickle, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, along with the man he hired to kill Austin.

This horror-filled theatrical incident sent the theater into disarray for a few years, Melnick said. But it reopened as The Cinefamily on Halloween in 2007, and shows everything from silent movies to contemporary films.

A short drive away from The Cinefamily is the New Beverly Cinema in West Hollywood.

Located in a primarily Orthodox Jewish neighborhood, the building stands out on the street with its pastel blue, lilac and pink exterior.

The theater’s movies have an offbeat personality as well.

The movie house started out in the 1920s as a vaudeville theater, and Quentin Tarantino bought the theater in 2007 to help operations. Today, the theater shows almost exclusively double-feature 35mm films from Tarantino’s personal collection.

***

For Melnick, the movie theater he chooses to go to is as much of a decision as which movie he should watch.

He takes all possible factors into consideration beforehand: whether he wants an intimate setting or a gigantic auditorium, if there will be a line outside where he can eagerly await the film with fellow moviegoers, if he can talk to people about the movie in the lobby afterward.

“Movie houses are far more than places where they show movies, it's about curating your own experience,” he said. “It's still one of the last places where people around the world gather with strangers for a not-religious experience.""

Unlike the experience of watching a movie alone, the reaction of the crowd changes the movie for him.

“People clapping after a movie, or walking out during it – the experience is more than a movie,” he said. “You can just lose yourself.”",5,""

Sometimes the only consolation I need is the fact that I am still breathing.

I am here. I’m alive.

With graduation drawing near, I trace my life on my calloused palms like a map – the places where I shouldn't have been and the places I needed to be. My journey growing up in the Philippines, moving to America and experiencing homelessness have all been part of building my life and legacy brick by brick. 

When I was 6 years old, I would sit on my grandmother's lap, my legs swinging against the cascade of her fuchsia  skirt. Mama dag enchanted her grandchildren with a perfume of lavender and jasmine, the familiar fragrance of security. 

Her warm embrace was the fortress I ran to when I knew I'd been bad and nimbus clouds of parental discipline were about to downpour. She was my guardian and her coconut oil was the healer. From chapped lips to a headache, Mama dag coated her fingers with the oil and hummed Arabic songs in her rich alto voice while kneading the hurt away. Afterwards, she smiled to remind me how lucky I was to be alive. She was right.

Born in the Philippines, I was the first son in my father's streak of daughters from his wild premarital past as an upcoming film director. I was my mother's first born. My eerie likeness to my father’s father – a painter and comedian called Perfecto – signaled an heir to complete my family’s legacy in the arts. My grandfather, Tatay Pogi, used to tell his rendition of my birth story in which I was a “badass” who wanted to get into the world so badly that I busted out my mother's inner walls earlier than expected. 

[img655]

But in reality, the truth was more serious. My mother gave birth prematurely to a boy who was blue. I was born with a lack of oxygen in my body and complications during my birth necessitated emergency procedures. I was either expected to not live very long, or suffer respiratory issues in adulthood. I fought my way into existence. 

That moment was a warning for me to prepare for the difficulties that would come. 

I was 7 years old when a close family friend took my innocence. I remember it was evening and I was wearing a Bugle Boy shirt and OshKosh jean shorts while watching Pokémon, my favorite show. I had laid out my new collection of trading cards as if the characters were there to watch it with me. 

But my family friend was watching me, not the show. 

While my attention was fixated on the screen, he picked up my hands and slid them up his shorts. I froze; I was startled and confused. He pressed a finger against his lips, signalling me to be quiet. I felt his fingers on my inner thighs. 

It continued for a couple weeks and I didn't utter a word about the incidents because I was afraid. At 7 years old, I didn't know what it meant. He told me that everyone does it and I believed him. Not long after, my aunt noticed that something was haunting me and caught him in the act. She told my parents and the rest of our family. I don’t know what happened to him or if justice was ever served. I don't want to ask because I still feel the shame. The intangible fingerprints on my limbs are evidence of the darkness in my narrative. They leave a burn coconut oil can’t salve.

***

Growing up, the rainy season in the Philippines was a dry spell of fun. 

To make the most of our indoor confinement, my little sister and I crafted paper boats. We tip toed while our grandfather was asleep. With one hand on the door, we dropped the boats down streams of rain in the gutter. Our eyes, like lighthouses, searched for their destination. My sister and I made up tales of where the boats would drift and wondered if they saved other kids stuck in their towers. The crafts coupled with imagination took us somewhere else.

When I look back on my time in the Philippines, I try to find paper boats in the storm. I can drown parts of my past, but the memories have dropped anchor, here with me. 

My family moved to America in the spring of 2003 because my father needed eye surgery. Leaving everything behind to start anew was a gamble; nevertheless, we chose to roll the dice. 

I gave my heartfelt goodbyes to my aunt, inhaled my grandmother’s lavender and jasmine as a keepsake and embraced Tatay Pogi for what would be the last time. 

My siblings and I were ready to make a run for the window seat on the plane, when we noticed our mother's tear-stained face. We knew that seeing our family back home wouldn’t be easy and the “see you soons” were too open ended. 

As soon as our feet kissed the Los Angeles shore, I felt like I was home. For me and my family, LA was a place where opportunities came in abundance. America was the home and the dream. We vacillated between the thorns that obstructed our path and the sweet scent of success that seduced us to work diligently.

My first days in 4th grade were not encouraging. No one played, talked or had lunch with me during breaks. The other students couldn't understand my English, because I habitually mixed it with Tagalog. Every time I told my dad about my humiliation in school, he told me the main reason he brought us to America was for a good education. So I read book after book and taught myself to speak better English. I started to wear my father’s hand-me-downs proudly in the hope that one day I would fill his spacious silhouette.

We led a good life, but my family’s happiness was short lived. My father contracted an irreversible fungal eye disease, which necessitated another surgery. With his mobility limited, he was laid off. My father was diagnosed as legally blind. 

My family opened a health-based business, but then the 2008 recession hit. Our neighbors watched as our car was repossessed, a humiliating experience. The landlord’s consistent pounding on the door and the phone’s constant ringing triggered my anxiety. To this day, I still keep my phone on silent.

In 2013, my family and I slept in a dilapidated van, embraced in darkness. At night, we would park on the streets and tried to sleep cushioned by our small material possessions. I looked up into lit windows to see families enjoying the comfort of their homes, while I took comfort in the warm presence of our chihuahua, Simba. I would quietly sing myself to sleep, hoping to wake up to reasons why our dice landed here.

[img653]

My family and I woke up early in the morning to find public bathrooms in Burbank we could bathe in. The running water was the temporary antidote to the sweat and tears from the night prior. We headed to any fast food chain for a dollar breakfast and visited a friend’s home to map out our day.

Going to school gave me a glimmer of hope. I pursued my education with tenacity, as if it were the last thread that held our survival together. My siblings and I went to class, then clocked in at our part-time jobs. At the end of the day, we would find ourselves a 24-hour McDonald’s to use their WiFi for homework. I typed a draft of my UCLA application on my phone with a french fry hanging from my lips. 

It was a dance that never missed a beat. The choreography we religiously devoted ourselves to were prayers and actions of faith. Even when life continued to knock the air out of us, our hope was a pendulum that would eventually swing back up.

We slowly garnered strength and saved enough money to no longer be homeless. Six months later, I found out that I got into UCLA. The acceptance letter came three days before my birthday and I don’t have words to describe how I felt. I remember looking up at the sky, feeling grateful for the grace that has sustained me. My acceptance to UCLA was the gateway to opportunities in the arts and continuing my family’s story.

It’s been 14 years since I came to America. Now my family and I live quietly in the suburbs of Los Angeles, but I still think about the riptides we’ve fought against and how far those paper boats have taken us.

[img656]

***

My gaze focuses on the steel frames, cranes and cinder blocks outside my apartment window. With all of its noise and clutter, truth still seems to shout its way across the street. As I look around my humble home, I think about what our family has built and how much further I can go.

I realize we’re always under construction, becoming more of ourselves. The calling we are following, the dreams we want to realize are right before us. Don’t look up, look forward. Our legacy is built every day by laying bricks. Some of us will build taller and faster. Some more quietly. I have learned to be patient with myself.

However, looking forward entails facing your doubts and taking risks. I am grateful for my challenges that many would liken to failure. I am still alive despite the reality of my fears. Failure allowed me to develop my inner strength and the passion that fueled my will to survive. You might never fail as I did, but there will be detours and setbacks. Keep building. Failure should not burn the bridge between hope and success; it should strengthen it all the more.

Despite the uncertainty, my weak lungs still breathe songs of gratitude for life’s valleys. Today, I feel as though I am navigating my two-decade-old body with an octogenarian heart – wounded and wandering, but still building.

","Having lived in Los Angeles for a little more than two years now, I’ve made a few obligatory visits to Griffith Park. But it wasn’t until recently that I ventured into a nook in the park and discovered Amir’s Garden.

[img407 fullwidth]

A sign at the park’s summit sheds a bit of light on the park’s history. After a fire in 1971, the trees burned down and the mountain side was blackened – the entire area became dead. As the story goes, a man named Amir Dialameh carried and planted hundreds of plants up the mountain. He cared for the garden and saw it flourish into a green oasis, continuing to tend to it until his death in 2003. Today, the park is nurtured by volunteers.

[img408 fullwidth]

Amir’s Garden is a small nook, tucked away on top of one of the park’s rolling hills. Compared to my Northern California home, lush greenery is much rarer in Southern California, but Amir’s Garden is as close as it gets.

[img409 fullwidth]

Two different paths lead up to Amir’s Garden. One of them is long and gradual, while the other is shorter but steeper and involves stairs. I recommend the second one, because it gives the best view of the valley below.

[img410 fullwidth]

The entire hike doesn’t take more than 20 minutes for the ascend – going at a leisurely pace – but that doesn’t mean it’s not strenuous. It’s directly uphill, so the stairs are decently steep. Taking short breaks to rest allows time to look at the incredible view of the city below and the mountains in the background. Going at sunset might provide a panoramic view of the color-changing sky.

[img411 fullwidth]

But what’s even better than the view are the plants that make up Amir’s Garden. At the top, there are various benches and tables nestled in between the greenery. Sitting up there among the trees almost makes me forget that I live in a city.

[img412 fullwidth]

As Amir would often say, “In the land of the free, plant a tree.”

*""La vida es sufrir.""*

Life is suffering.

I was sitting in my grandmother’s kitchen two days after my high school graduation when she cupped my face and said this to me. Her hands left their work at the stove to direct my gaze, to say, “Look at me.” She was earnest and unafraid.

Three years after she said them, I hear her words in my sleep.

I believe there is a place between the worlds of the living and the dead where diasporic peoples imagine the things they cannot know: unreal abstractions of ancestors who lived on different soil, the winding roads of a place that is home in their blood and their bones. This is the place where my grandmother’s words have come to resonate – somewhere imagined, half-alive, singing with the magic of old truths passed down.

This is the place where I imagine a legacy that gives my life meaning.

When I arrived at UCLA, I had not thought about being Mexican – really thought about it, as more than a box I checked on forms – in years. It is in fact possible that I had never thought about it at all.

The fact of my Mexican-ness was like the fact of my home address – a thing over which I had no say and to which I could not ascribe very much importance if I tried. This was, I thought, how it was supposed to be. Shouldn’t I focus on other ways to define myself? Things I had control over, things I could create myself?

Slowly, though, I began to have experiences that unnerved me, shook me up, left me angry. I was at once committed to the path I had chosen for myself – one that ignored race, one where I felt allowed to create a self that felt no burden of difference – and unable to reconcile that path with my own conscience.

During my second year, while some of my friends from home started involving themselves in Chicana/o activism and solidarity movements at their respective colleges, I joined the newspaper, where I could count the number of brown people on staff on one hand. This choice felt both innocuous and momentous – I was choosing who I would be, where I would stand. I have never regretted this decision, but I have regretted the quick and flippant way I cast off whole parts of myself to make it.

During my third year, I started going out a lot on the weekends. Every week, it was something new: a man grabbed my hair in his fist and asked me “what I was,"" another told me I was pretty for a Hispanic girl. I went home thinking quietly about feeling othered – how my white girlfriends were also getting harassed, but how my harassment felt different somehow. Not worse, exactly, but different.

I carried the sense of difference with me into the street, into my friendships. I could not stand to cook things my roommate looked at funny. I bought Mexican candy at the store and never ate it. I looked around at every friend I made in college and could not count a single brown face in the entire bunch.

I began to wonder why I felt so uncomfortable. I began to remember things.

When she was 5 years old, my little sister started going to kindergarten in the predominantly white area we had just moved to. She met a blond-haired, blue-eyed little girl for the first time that day and came home reporting to us all that she had “met a real princess.” Throughout elementary school, she would tell me over and over in our room that she wanted to have lighter skin.

I remembered being a teenager, looking at my face in the bathroom mirror and frantically, desperately, illogically wanting blue eyes.

I remembered my mother: the way she never says no, the way quiet resentment builds in a household where no one thinks to ask her if she’s tired.

It has only been through remembering these things that I have managed to move past them. It has only been through the shared pain, triumph and strength of the women in my family that I have managed to find a profound kind of grace within myself.

I think of my grandmother now, cupping my face and giving me a warning rooted in love. It’s possible she was not trying to tell me anything except exactly what she said, something sad and true of her own life. But I see it now as a legacy of the women in my family.

I listen to her telling me that life is suffering, and I hear a generations-long story about women I have never met and do not know, but whom I imagine in a place between the worlds of the living and the dead.

[img313 fullwidth]

I hear something ancient and powerful in her, and I feel something profound in me too, in my own conviction to cup my grandmother’s face in my hands and tell her that it doesn’t have to be that way.

Did I remember to take my pill last night? How do I look? How is this day going to go?

My shoes crunch over snow as I walk toward the cliff.

How many miles do I have to hike today? What do my friends think of me? I wonder what we’re eating for breakfast.

I move past trees weighed down by blankets of snow.

Is my camera OK? What if the cold is too much? I think I need a new one. What am I going to do after high school? Will college be OK?

I reach the edge of the cliff and stop.

Half Dome stares right at me on the mountain across. The campsite and forest surrounding me is covered by fresh snow. The air is silent, and my mind goes blank. I breathe deeply, taking in the cold, fresh air and release it in a visible, ephemeral cloud. The only quick, audible noise comes from my hands releasing the camera shutter for a picture.

All my worries and thoughts are forgotten, ideas and opinions lost, angers and frustrations disappeared.

Clinical depression runs deep on my mother’s side of the family. My grandmother suffers from it, and my mom underwent therapy, so it made sense that it would be passed on to either my sister or myself. It hit me, and it hit hard.

Thoughts of sadness, worry and fatigue suction onto my brain and won’t let go. I’ve had days where my thought process was so controlled by negative emotions that it no longer felt that I was controlling my body, like a dementor squeezing all happiness and care from me.

At first, I hated the outdoors. I was dragged out on tiring walks with my family and climbed up never-ending mountains in Maine that only made my knees hurt and body ache. But that ache turned bearable as my body grew stronger, and after years of adventurous travels to different environments, I saw more of the world and loved it more. I stood out from most of my high school friends, who had never gone camping and weren’t used to the experiences of summiting mountains or hiking through forests.

During a vacation in high school with my family, we hiked through Coyote Buttes North near the border of Utah and Arizona when we began hiking through a series of petrified sand dunes.

I walked alone into the dunes, immersed in silence and surrounded by walls shifting in shape. Reds, oranges and yellows were all naturally painted into the delicate and fragile sand walls. Seeing the incredible beauty of what lay in front, all my problems seemed minute and incomparable to the greater sense of wonder that the world and my environment offered.

This feeling of being overpowered by nature shook my emotions to their core and made me realize the true importance and purpose of living.
The summer before my freshman year of college, I went on a weeklong backpacking trip into Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite with Outdoor Adventures, a group within UCLA Recreation that leads UCLA students on backpacking and camping trips. During one of our hikes, we stopped by a waterfall to take a dip.
I wanted to be more adventurous, so I started climbing up the mountain of boulders that the waterfall ran down. As I carefully stretched my legs and arms up each slippery surface, I slowly made it to the top. Perched on the head, I looked down at the water rushing in and out of the giant wall of rock crevices I had just scaled.

I was in complete awe of how I had conquered the feat without falling, but even more excited to see what was below me.

Many of the guides and students had seen my inspirational solo journey, and followed in my footsteps. After everyone had climbed to me, we all looked out over the lake and expanse of forest that laid in the distance.

From the flow of water to the grass meadows and mountain ridges beyond, it was like a scene out of a painting. And it wasn’t just the landscape that moved me, but the people I was with. They had all shared the same daring vision of adventure to scale the climb and join me for some fun at the top.

Sunbathing on rocks in Joshua Tree, taking deep inhales of air from under the giant sequoias looming over me, Half Dome’s presence catapulting my mind into a state of awe and searing sunset hikes in Idaho replaced my thoughts with sensorial dopamine.

My mind was so taken over by the beauty and groundbreaking feelings of being in nature, that I was no longer Owen Emerson, but a singular being freely existing and knowing no boundaries. This was the ultimate therapy to my affliction, a way to wipe my mind of the noise inside and replace it with Mother Nature.

I took my pill, but I didn’t need it. I looked amazing. The day was great.

I never recorded how far I traveled. My friends were always there for me. Breakfast was delicious.

Since moving into my new apartment, I’ve been trying to find a way to make it more homey. At my house in Sacramento, I have more than 20 fruit trees, grapevines, a vegetable garden and countless basil and mint plants. Unfortunately, I don’t have enough room in my apartment for fruit trees and grapevines, and I don’t think I am responsible enough to tend to a vegetable patch. So an herb garden it is!

In order to make this easier to fit into a college apartment, I opted to make an eggshell herb garden. Eggshells are small, easy to store and already abundant in my apartment. They also supply nourishment to the growing seeds as well as being biodegradable. So it’s a win-win.

The eggshells are used to get the plants started. After the seeds sprout, plant them in a pot and watch the herbs flourish.

For my mini garden, I planted mint and basil. Both of these require about four hours of sunlight a day. They can be grown year-round, but keep temperatures at about 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray them with water every one to two days.

9,4,Recipe: Snacking on fruits and ve(chip)tables,recipe-snacking-fruits-and-vechiptables,prime/winter-2014/lead/recipie.jpg,"Daily Bruin Mojo blogger Amy Giroux's recipe for simple, healthy and delicious fruit and vegetable chips. ","I am prone to frequent snack attacks. The kind that has you staring at the pantry for a solid 10 minutes, trying to decide what on earth your taste buds are craving. Sweet? Salty? Tummy-filling or just a bite? Midday or midnight, this snack habit is usually the adversary of my dinner appetite and my waistline. After almost four years of college, I have finally learned how to channel my snack cravings into a healthy habit with fruit and veggie chips.

# Basic recipe

[img74 fullwidth]

Slice fruits and veggies as thinly as possible. Though you can use a sharp knife to make all your cuts, I highly recommend purchasing a mandolin – it’s totally worth the investment. Our local City Target has them for about $13.

[img73 fullwidth]

Using a separate bowl for each chip flavor, lightly toss vegetables in olive oil – just enough to cover each piece. For fruits, toss apples and pears in lemon juice – again, using just enough to cover each piece. Do not oversaturate your fruits and veggies. Avoid berries – too much juice and sugar – but mangoes also make excellent candidates.

[img75 fullwidth]

Add desired seasonings to the bowl in proportions based on your own preferences. See the table below for our ideas.

[img125 fullwidth]

After coating chips in the bowls with olive oil/lemon juice and seasonings, lay each piece on a prepared baking sheet lined with parchment paper. (Note: If you use aluminum foil to cover your cookie sheets, make sure to use butter to grease the foil. Otherwise, the sugar will stick and your chips will burn to a crisp.) Ensure that pieces do not touch.

[img72 fullwidth]

Sprinkle a light layer of seasonings of your choice over the chips.

Bake at the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit noted on the table below. Multiple types can be baked on the same sheet or at the same time, but make sure you watch them carefully. The line between “perfect” and “burnt” is a matter of minutes.

Flip the chips using a fork, spatula or tongs midway through baking. Chips are finished when the edges begin to crisp and curl and the pieces are no longer floppy or moist.

Toss the veggie chips with sea salt just prior to serving if desired.

[img76 fullwidth]

Chips may be kept in an airtight container or bag for up to one week (if you don’t eat them all before then).

On any given day in Santa Monica, musicians, acrobats and other performers draw crowds to their sounds and movements. They can be found on the pier near crashing Pacific waves or along Third Street’s cement curbs, providing visitors and shoppers with a walking tour of live urban art. Here are a few of their faces.

“I do a lot of stuff that most people would look at me and go, ‘This guy’s on drugs,’ or ‘This guy’s got a death wish.’ But it’s kind of a little strange way of celebrating my life. I like to look death in the face. … The world out here is a gym, so I train, push myself every day.

Mostly I work on just shutting fear off. Just shut that fear switch off. And when you shut that fear off, all the magic happens. The whole world’s so fear-based. When you actually learn to shut it off, you get that adrenaline, and adrenaline is the key to success.” 

– Kane Serfin

“Well, I normally perform in clubs and concerts, but I was born in Santa Monica, so whenever I’m in the area I always like to stop by and touch the soil again. It all began here for me.

All my life, since I was 10 years old, I’ve been writing music. And I’ve been traveling around the world for the last 10 years, all over Europe, South America, everywhere you think of. It’s amazing how much more singer-songwriter vintage music is appreciated in other places than here in the States. You know, when I play in Europe it’s like there’s a silence everywhere I play. People would just, ‘It’s an American singer-songwriter! It’s Bob Dylan!’ Over here, it’s like you’re lost in a crowd of noise.

I am who I am. It’s all about the music anyway.”

I do this because not a lot of people do it. And I love these people. I love these people, you know. But it’s hard to reach them. Hard to just say, “Hi, I love you.” But if you do a street show, and they see you’re awesome, then they look up to you. ... So I cultivated my art, my craft, and that allowed me a platform to be able to communicate with different people, and as I learn other languages, people respect me more.”

66,8,Insuring Identity,insuring-identity,prime/spring-2015/lead/Transgender.jpg,Transgender students at UCLA face a myriad of challenges,"[img371 fullwidth]

Bo Hwang was 15 years old when he started to realize his gender identity didn’t align with his biological sex.

“Growing up, I always thought I was a boy,” said Hwang, a first-year gender studies student. “I didn’t realize until middle school that there was a difference between boys and girls.”

But he didn’t immediately embrace his identity as a transgender man. Hwang said he was still unsure about his gender identity when he was a teenager, though he remembers wanting to transition since high school.

It wasn’t until he found a community of openly queer students at UCLA that Hwang decided he definitely wanted to transition away from his biologically assigned sex and eventually embrace his true gender identity as a man.

A number of UCLA students – somewhere between 50 and 400 – identify as transgender. They face challenges on many levels as they try to fit into the UCLA community, including discrimination and tough choices about how to transition both socially and physically.

The decision to take steps toward gender reassignment often weighs heavily on the minds of young transgender people, many of whom encounter the chance to make medical, social and financial decisions on their own for the first time at college.

For Hwang, the decision over whether or not to transition came down to finances.

He wants to wait to undergo gender reassignment until he has the financial means to support himself and access to health insurance that will pay for the procedures and ongoing medical treatment he will need.

“I will need to take one or two shots a month for the rest of my life,” he said.

Insurance-covered medical care for transgender people was hard to come by until last year. In May 2014, a U.S. Department of Health and Services review board ruled that Medicare recipients cannot be automatically denied coverage for gender reassignment procedures.

[img374 fullwidth]

While the ruling doesn’t seem to have direct impact on the majority of UCLA students – most 18- to 24-year-olds are not eligible for Medicare coverage – it was widely speculated that the ruling indicated a shift in insurance policies for younger patients, in both the public and private sector.

But even before this ruling, UCLA students had access to some transgender health services, including gender reassignment procedures. The University of California Student Health Insurance Plan covers ""medically necessary"" gender reassignment surgery and other services for transgender patients.

Doctors and health insurance companies determine medical necessity on a case-by-case basis for each patient. This depends on a number of factors, including how the person is progressing in therapy and whether that person has met certain benchmarks to qualify for surgical procedures.

Since August 2010, UC SHIP has covered $1.4 million in medical claims related to transgender procedures, treatments and services, said UC spokeswoman Shelly Meron in an email statement. Overall, students have filed about 127 claims related to transgender health care over the past five years.

But health care for transgender Americans isn’t guaranteed by all insurance companies. Many insurance companies won’t offer any coverage related to transgender health concerns, whether that includes therapy, surgeries or hormone treatments.

Even government-supported insurance doesn’t necessarily cover transgender health care.

TRICARE, the federally funded insurance provided to military service members and their families, only covers sex changes if “gender confusion is documented from birth.” This would essentially restrict access to sex changes to people who were born hermaphrodites or with no clear sexual identification and would withhold procedures from transgender individuals who embraced their gender identity later in life. Several other private insurance companies hold similar policies regarding transgender-related health care.

However, for most transgender individuals, gender identity emerges as they grow up and begin to develop a conception of what gender means to them.

[img373 fullwidth]

Nyala Carbado, a first-year history and African American studies student, began to notice their gender identity in ninth grade.

“For me, I think it’s hard (to define) because sometimes I feel like I’m gender-fluid, going between genders, and other times I feel like I’m agender,” Carbado said.

Carbado identifies as genderqueer and prefers the pronouns they, them and theirs.

They described the issue of gender identity as separate from sexual orientation, and said they think this distinction is something many UCLA students and people are unaware of.

Regardless of their gender identity, transgender people have a sexual orientation that varies across a spectrum of sexual identities, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual and asexual. Gender identity only relates to a personal perception of gender and gender expression.

“There’s a sense of not being interested in learning about it,” they said. “The diversity requirement is one of the first steps (toward more education). Just one class can really help to open one’s mind and help people see things in somebody else’s perspective.”

Carbado said they think just being exposed to transgender people and the human rights issues facing that community will help improve the lives of students whose gender identity doesn’t fit perfectly with their biologically assigned sex.

They added that gender identity is complicated by many factors, such as race, age and gender presentation.

“Sometimes, because I do pass as male, I don’t wear my hoodie when I’m walking alone at night,” Carbado said.

Carbado, who is black, said the prejudices against black men can affect them even though they do not identify as a man.

In addition to various levels of intersecting identities within the queer community, Carbado said they felt as if their actions were often perceived as an indication of the queer community at large.

“What I do reflects the queer community,” Carbado said. “A lot of people feel that way.”

Hwang agreed that his actions are often taken to represent those of all transgender men, but he said he thinks the conflation is not fair or productive.

“Some people treat me like the golden boy, and treat me like I represent all trans men,” he said. “It’s really hard for me because I have so many different identities: Asian, low-income, Christian.”

Hwang said balancing all of these different identities has led to some discrimination, but he has also noticed acceptance of his identity as a Korean transgender man who holds his faith in God as an important part of his life.

Hwang recalled a time when two students he'd met before were walking down Bruin Walk and pointed him out as they passed by. In Korean, they gossiped about his gender identity and expressed disbelief that Hwang was really a man.

[img372 fullwidth]

“They thought that I didn’t speak Korean, but I speak fluent Korean,” he said. “It’s kind of hard. When (people) misgender me, I start to become quiet and I feel smaller. I feel like my voice doesn’t matter.”

Other times, Hwang said he has benefited from people’s perceptions of his gender presentation. He said he doesn’t often encounter issues when using public restrooms, because strangers tend to accept his identity as a man without question.

“I think I’m privileged because I’m Korean,” he said. “No one questions my gender much. My white trans friends get confronted more often.”

Both Hwang and Carbado said the queer community at UCLA has been an important support system.

“It’s a small number of people, but they’re very active,” Carbado said. “You always see them at causes, even if they are not queer causes. That’s one of the reasons I’m proud to be in that community.”

Hwang didn’t have a community of peers at his high school or community college.

“It was rare to meet a queer person, let alone a trans person,” he said. “There’s a huge (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community on campus. I really like that.”

Hwang said it was because of the queer community at UCLA that he decided to officially come out as a transgender man and start presenting his gender as male. He said when he saw transgender people at UCLA who were out and happy because of their decision, he was sure he wanted to transition as well.

For now, Hwang is psychologically and socially transitioning to his masculine gender identity. He said he’s coming out and using male spaces regularly.

“I want to be as open as possible,” he said. “I want to educate and raise awareness, because I want people to take action (for transgender rights).”",6,""

115,13,All Abroad: Rome,all-abroad-rome,prime/fall-2016/lead/web.abroad.Lindsay.jpg,"","[img514 fullwidth]

If I’m completely honest, when I booked my trip to Italy I didn’t really think it through. A friend of mine suggested that I see a little of Europe before settling into my study abroad program. At that moment, all I could think of was how much I loved pasta – so I chose to go to Rome.

At first, the complicated parts of the trip – the summer weather (hot), the language barrier (frustrating), traveling alone (amazing) – didn’t register as very significant. Despite being an incredibly organized person – I keep four calendars at a time – I quickly realized how low-maintenance I could be, and needed to be, while traveling.

As I stepped off the plane, I practically fell over hitting the near-solid humidity. The terminal was filled with locals returning from vacation, so few people spoke English and plenty of them stared at the clearly lost American girl wandering through the airport.

My plane landed late in the evening. By the time I had to find my Airbnb, it was already dark and I was hopelessly lost. My taxi driver spoke no English and was unfamiliar with the area, and I couldn’t figure out how to get in touch with the hosts I was staying with. I eventually found the apartment, and I can’t describe my relief at hearing English after what felt like days of confusing Italian. It had been three hours.

I stayed in a residential area about 30 minutes outside of downtown Rome. The people in the area already had little reason to speak English. Few tourists ventured out that way, and since it was August, when many Europeans go on holiday, there were even fewer people around, shrinking the pool of English speakers even further.

But while that isolation felt lonely at times, it was also freeing. Without anyone else to travel with, there was no expectation to stick to a particular schedule. I wandered around various neighborhoods in Rome with no idea where I was going, and ended up seeing more of the city than I would have otherwise. Naturally, this could have been because my sense of direction is exceptionally poor. But without anyone to really guide me toward the big attractions, I ended up exploring smaller neighborhoods and lingering over the quieter attractions.

My favorite spot was Largo di Torre Argentina, the site where Julius Caesar was murdered, which is now a stray cat sanctuary. It became my home base while out of my Airbnb, since it was near the center of downtown Rome, but quiet (and shady) enough to catch my breath and get reoriented. The sanctuary is set below the pavement, but is surrounded by busy streets and shops. Every once in a while a stray cat would appear, looking perfectly comfortable and entirely wrong on the ancient, sacred ruins.

Since I was by myself at all these places, people-watching often invited some strange interactions – one Italian man asked me to sniff a leaf and then rambled in mangled English about Roman fountains and his trip to Boston.

And eventually, I got used to only hearing Italian. It became somewhat startling to easily understand what people were saying, and I can’t explain how proud I was when I could manage a halting conversation in Italian. I picked it up through the laborious efforts on the part of my hosts, and the hour or so they spent on my first night in Rome teaching me very simple words and giggling politely behind their hands at my horrific accent. From there, a few waiters took pity on me and would repeat everything they said in both English and Italian, until I could ask for water and other basics with a passable accent that has gone dormant since.

The strangest thing about traveling alone was that I wasn’t scared. Even with all the warnings I received about pickpockets in Rome, I didn’t feel especially threatened. The most threatened I felt was when I wandered into a coffee bar that was filled to bursting with construction workers getting their midmorning espresso. And even that was only scary because they clearly knew what to do, and I somehow managed to trip over my own feet and then gag on the incredibly strong espresso.

In Rome, I got to be completely independent – I set my own schedule, I chose where and when to eat. I got to be truly on my own.
By the end of my nine-day trip, I knew the general layout of the different city neighborhoods, I could speak very, very basic Italian and had perfected the language of charades. I also came to realize that having four calendars is useful, but it’s just as useful to be able to relax and do what suits me in the moment – even if that means getting gelato three times in one day.

Rakeem Cunningham is no stranger to eccentric outfits and 7 a.m. call times. On a pristine blue morning at the Santa Monica Pier, onlookers stop to observe a model clad in a textured oversized coat and monochrome white, unaware that the photographer behind the lens is a student at UCLA. Cunningham, a fourth-year Design | Media Arts student who said he used to hate the idea of shooting fashion, only started taking photos professionally in his second year, after helping his fashion designer cousin. Since then, through working with a variety of magazines, such as Chasseur and Rocket, he has discovered a knack for conceptual photography.

Unable to find a fashion organization he identified with on campus, Cunningham turned to real-world sources, exposing himself to designers, trends and changing fashion seasons around the world in the process.

[img154 fullwidth]

“When I first started, I wanted to do a James Dean-themed shoot in the middle of summer,” Cunningham said. “My friends were like, Rakeem … it doesn’t work like that.”

Cunningham’s volume of work reflects a passion for capturing simple, understated aesthetics and a photographic style that appears raw and effortless.

[img155 fullwidth]

“Oh, but it’s effort,” Cunningham quipped. “My work doesn’t have to be groundbreaking, it just has to be something creative I haven’t done before.”

Right now, Cunningham describes his work as “British,” pointing to the U.K.’s mixture of daring, high-end street wear, such as kilts with nose rings and layered jerseys.

“I’m attracted to dark, somber subjects that aren’t as PG as my photography once was,” Cunningham said. He cites his favorite photographer, Tim Walker, who uses film to create ethereal images in dark, moody settings, as a major source of inspiration.

Although Cunningham has learned to incorporate a fluid mesh of fine arts and design into his work today, the realization that the two styles could complement each other did not come easily.

[img156 right]

While in a photography class as a fine arts student, Cunningham was told by his professor that his fashion-related projects did not fit the realm of fine arts.

“So for my next idea, I used a photo of my sister with a sign reading, ‘Is this art now?’ And then I switched majors,” Cunningham said. “But it’s funny because now, I’m really enjoying mixing the two. I’m learning you don’t have to know exactly what you want to do, but if you work at something hard enough, people will notice and respond.”

Through the collaborative, detailed process of fashion photography, Cunningham has created strong, lasting relationships with stylists, models and creatives alike. In fact, his shoot for prime magazine features celebrity stylist Wilford Lenov, whom Cunningham met two years ago and has creatively grown with ever since.

Lenov said that the moment he really appreciated and respected Cunningham’s art was last summer, when Cunningham broke his leg and the pair worked together constantly to fulfill his need to keep photographing.

“We were shooting by Broad (Art Center), and as soon as I turned my back away to fix something, his wheelchair started slowly falling backwards, and I hear, ‘Wilford. Wilford?’” Lenov said, laughing. “To want it that bad ... it’s crazy, and it’s inspiring.”

[img157 left]

Before this year, Cunningham admits he was scared to express his opinions about the negative aspects of the industry he’s in. Lenov added that recently, Cunningham’s work has become far more bold and daring.

For his senior project, Cunningham created a video about different things he experienced as a 21-year-old, including depression, sexuality, racism, creativity and artistic freedom.

“I’ve found that the more I’m honest and true to myself, the more people react to it, and it’s really empowering,” Cunningham said. “I want to do things that satisfy me creatively, and the ripples that have resulted have just been insane.”

As for his future? “I have absolutely no idea,” Cunningham said.

Cunningham dreams of shooting the cover of Vogue someday, but for now, his main interest lies in fine arts and expressing experimental ideas.

“All I know now is that I want to keep creating. Hopefully in New York or London. That would be my aha moment.”

In the spirit of summer indulgence, we at prime decided to give you both: sweet and spicy.

# ""The Sweet Nostalgic""
**Milk Jar Cookies** | 5466 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036

[img163 right]

Located a few blocks from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevard, this charming little cookie bakery is a simple bus ride away. Immediately visible is its white, vintage-country aesthetic, which makes you feel quite at home. A chandelier of its namesake milk jars hangs from the ceiling and music from the ‘50s plays as customers walk up to the counter and make their selections.
The price of a cookie ($3) might seem steep, but trust us, they are filling. Banana Split, one of the most popular cookies, has a strawberry baked into the cookie and tastes a lot like sweet banana bread with butterscotch chips. Chocolate Pecan Caramel, although rich and moist, is strong enough to hold together despite a thick, gooey caramel center. The pecans add a nice crunch, too. Next time we’ll try White Chocolate Raspberry and Rocky Road.

[img164 fullwidth]

Beverages include, but are not limited to, mini or large jars of milk from local dairies and iced mochas made with Los Angeles-roasted coffee served in mason jars. As they say at Milk Jar, “Life’s short, eat cookies.”

[img165 fullwidth]

# ""The Cozy Cafe""
**Churros Calientes** | 11521 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90025

[img167 right]

If you don’t know it’s there, it’s easy to miss this little shop on your way into Santa Monica. Open on the weekends and in the evenings on weekdays, Churros Calientes is the perfect spot for dessert when you’re craving something a bit different. Just a few blocks west of Sawtelle Boulevard, forget the boba for an evening and splurge on churros – you won’t regret it.

Its signature, churros con chocolate ($7) gives you six thin churros sprinkled with sugar (no cinnamon) and a teacup of thick, Spanish-style hot chocolate for dipping and sipping. Each bite starts with a quick crisp followed by a warm, light dough on the inside.

[img168 left]

If you don’t love chocolate, we recommend you try the basic churros calientes option ($4) or a churros grande ($5). With each churros grande you can pick a filling and a topping — cream cheese filling with guava drizzling is one of their most popular. The warm cream cheese is sweet but not overwhelming and has a consistency more similar to sour cream. The guava on top is just enough to get the sweet, strong fruity taste without getting the churro soggy.

If you have a big group and are worried about seating (intimate yes, but space can get a bit tight), churros are also available to go.

[img166 fullwidth]

# ""The Mom and Pop Shop with a Kick""
**Beverly Soon Tofu Restaurant** | 2717 W. Olympic Blvd. Ste. 108, Los Angeles, CA 90006

[img161 fullwidth]

The siren call of delicious all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue is difficult to ignore when you are in Koreatown, but when you do it pays off.

Beverly Soon Tofu Restaurant, located in a little strip mall on a corner, is some of the best tofu soup we’ve ever had. Inside the small restaurant, guests sit on wooden benches at tables that look like they were carved from a tree.

For $8.99 you can choose between 10 soft tofu soups cooked plain, mild, medium or spicy. We tried the spicy combination with beef, oyster and baby clam. The spice level wasn’t too intense for being their hottest, but it did provide a strong, flavorful kick. If you like spicy food that burns your mouth, you likely won’t find it here but you’ll still be wanting water.

[img162 fullwidth]

Also highly recommended are the combinations with large portions, like a full-size bowl of bibimbap or a whole spicy barbecue squid ($16.99). The squid, which comes sizzling on a skillet, has a more obvious heat factor. Cooked in spicy red sauce, you can taste the peppers.

Every meal comes with standard side dishes (banchan) and ice-cold barley tea. The barley flavor is strong, so you might want to ask for water if it’s not to your taste.

# ""The Friendly Italian""
**Fritto Misto Italian Café** | 601 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90407

[img169 right]

A welcoming yellow wall, hand-painted plates and tables made of wine crates greet you when you enter, giving off a warmhearted Italian feel.

Start with the fried pillows. The warm, creamy herb ricotta inside complements the chewiness of the dough — dip them in pineapple cocktail sauce and enjoy.

We were impressed to see no less than seven pastas labeled with either “hot” or “spicy” on the menu, so we decided to try the Atomic Pasta. Served with two well-spiced chicken breasts on linguini and a bed of various peppers with a chipotle-like sauce, this pasta uses its spice for a purpose, not just raw heat. Consider it pasta with a bit of pep. We should also add that the portions are huge and, at $15.25, this was one of the more expensive items on the overall affordable menu.

[img171 fullwidth]

There’s also the option to create your own pasta. Curious, with the guidance of our waitress, we tried our luck with black and white spaghettini, shrimp and artichoke hearts with chipotle sauce. Colored black by squid ink, the spaghettini had a slightly tougher texture than standard pasta and went well with the shrimp and tender artichoke hearts.

If you get a chance, try the flourless cake. Served with a whopping dollop of thick whipped cream, this dense chocolate cake is best shared. The food was great but the service really set this little Italian restaurant apart.

Of all the neighborhoods in Los Angeles, Los Feliz is my favorite. It is best known as the equally as hipster but somewhat more gentrified next-door neighbor of the ever-trendy Silver Lake, and I discovered the area shortly after learning to drive. It was love at first sight.

Charming Spanish-style bungalows from the 1920s line the blocks up until the business district, which is chock full of funky vintage stores, used vinyl shops, old brick buildings and food options from Greek to Brazilian.

The neighborhood is nestled directly at the base of Griffith Park (the largest municipal park in the country – take that New York), and the famed Griffith Observatory can be seen easily from the streets.

But it’s not just the food, shopping or proximity to interesting places that make Los Feliz unique. The energy is young and creative, and it’s clear that people from all over the city flock there for the neighborhood’s charm and relaxed vibe. There are multiple bookstores, record stores, arts and crafts stores – it’s intellectual and funky at the same time, in a way that Venice can’t quite match. Los Feliz is like the anti-Brentwood: There’s not a Range Rover soccer mom for miles.

As a native Angeleno, I like to consider myself somewhat of an expert on this city’s ins and outs. You can’t learn this city in a day or even a year. But if you have a free afternoon to spend exploring anywhere across town, make it Los Feliz. You won’t be sorry.

On the east side of North Vermont Avenue, just south of Franklin Avenue, there’s an unusual patch of sidewalk.

Imbedded in the concrete are a random assortment of keys, door locks, a fork, a knife and an imprint of where a spoon used to be. In the middle, the number “62” has been scrawled into the cement by hand.

The number isn’t random, of course. It’s referencing the eclectic diner not even 3 feet away: Fred 62.

Colloquially known as Fred’s, you can’t miss it as you walk into the heart of Los Feliz – the restaurant is painted a vibrant green with garish orange awnings.

[img141 fullwidth]

Inside, a somewhat less neon – though no less eccentric – world awaits. Retro booths and a classic diner countertop are nestled comfortably beneath funky ‘60s light fixtures. There’s even a window seat where patrons can sit on cushions and look out at passersby while chowing down on onion rings.

Open 24 hours a day, seven days a week since 1997, Fred’s is the stalwart companion of 3 a.m. diners and 2 p.m. brunchers. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served round the clock.

The food is good but also cheap, which makes it dangerous. I have, on more than one occasion, ordered french toast, fries and mac ‘n cheese in a single sitting.

The food is funny too. Breakfast sandwiches have names like “The Sammy Davis Jr.” (smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, cream cheese and hash browns, $12) and “The Berkeley” (goat cheese, avocado, scrambled eggs and hash browns, $9), while dinner specials include “The Partridge Family” (pan-fried chicken with mashed potatoes and a mini waffle, $16) and “The Lisa Simpson” (a tajine tofu scramble with couscous, $13).

Scattered across the walls in Fred’s are a number of framed paintings, almost of all of which were done by notable Angeleno artist and set designer Wayne White of “Pee-wee’s Playhouse” fame. The paintings are landscapes with giant phrases painted over them in block lettering.

Even at 2 p.m., people around me were ordering breakfast. An elderly couple at a nearby table was grilling the waiter on what exactly “Eggs in the Hole” ($9) is – as it turns out, it’s a piece of toast with the center cut out and an egg cooked inside.

***

Directly next door to Fred’s is the paragon of quirky stores, Popkiller Dept.

A small storefront jam-packed with merchandise, it houses a wide array of vintage clothes and cute jewelry. I once managed to snag a Pope John Paul II crop top there as a Christmas gift for a friend.

But among the vintage lie gag gifts – funny random trinkets and objects that no one really needs, but are amusing to have just the same. Purses shaped like hamburgers, pasta shaped like breasts, a piece of plastic you put in with your toast that makes an imprint of Jesus – you name it, Popkiller has it. They also have an unusually wide array of plastic animal head masks.

[img140 fullwidth]

Down the block is the Los Feliz 3 Cinemas, which has been showing movies daily since 1934. It has a beautiful vintage neon marquee and a giant mural of famous actors on the side. The theaters are intimate and charming, and when I saw “Slumdog Millionaire” there I cried so hysterically that two employees heard me from outside and came in to make sure I was okay (seriously).

But past the cinema lies the neighborhood’s greatest gem. As one of the last independent bookstores in the city, Skylight Books is a sight for sore eyes.

[img143 right]

Opened in 1996, in what was even then a declining climate for small bookstores, Skylight Books is a delightful relic. It has a homeyness that neither Barnes & Noble nor Amazon can recreate.

The bookshelves are filled with current bestsellers and classics, but there’s a special section devoted to LGBT and feminist literature, as well as a whole area for books about Los Angeles. In the midst of shelves and shelves of books is a live tree growing in the middle of the store near the eponymous skylight.

The tree, which has been growing since the store opened, was the brainchild of one of the original partners, who insisted on having a special circular bench built around its base so that customers could sit and enjoy the atmosphere, said Kerry Slattery, the general manager and co-owner.

[img142 fullwidth]

“A lot of people, even though they’ve been in the store, don’t register that there’s a live tree in the middle,” Slattery added.

But no visit to Skylight Books would be complete without meeting the bookstore cat. Known as Franny, the adorable tabby is actually the second cat to call the store home, Slattery said. She even has an Instagram (@frannyskylight), where you can catch glimpses of the bookstore from her point of view.

About a five-minute walk away (or a two-minute drive if you’re as lazy as I am), is Hillhurst Avenue, which boasts a number of lovely restaurants and shops. The street was even the site of Dumb Starbucks, the parody store that was open briefly earlier this year.

On the west side of the street, just north of Franklin Avenue, is Alcove Café and Bakery.

The restaurant is cozy and inviting, with a red brick exterior and trendy but tasteful indoor style. However, it’s the charming patio that makes the experience worth it – whether you sit on the front patio or the side, both are littered with greenery and eclectic furniture.

Although it serves breakfast, lunch and dinner (all of which are delicious), it’s the baked goods and beverages that keep you coming back. Any of the chocolate cakes are outrageously rich, though I decided to sample the fresh fruit tart and a chai latte this time.

***

The biggest challenge in Los Feliz is not the distance from campus, but rather the parking. Here are my secrets:

When parking on North Vermont Avenue, there is a public metered city lot on the side street directly next to Fred 62 (Russell Avenue). That’s your best bet, though there is street parking on the residential streets nearby. Be careful though, the signs are tricky and parking enforcement lies in wait. On Hillhurst Avenue, you can splurge for valet at Alcove Café and Bakery ($5), or go north a block and park in the Albertsons lot next to The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Do not park in any of the bank lots, because they’re eager to tow, even after hours. Otherwise, any sort of metered parking will do.",1,""

**Favorite clothing label:**

Stone Cold Fox

**Favorite style icons:**

Jennifer Grace, author of fashion blog ""Native Fox,"" and model Natasha Oakley

[img414 fullwidth]

**How would you describe your style?**

Definitely ""cool California."" Blue is my favorite color, so I feel like I fall along those lines: a lot of whites, a lot of blacks and a lot of blue.

I'm an ocean lifeguard in San Diego. Beaches are a huge part of my life, and I always tend to want to be near it no matter what I'm doing in life. For me, I don't ever want to live somewhere far away and I feel that influences everything, including my fashion – just being Southern California coastal.

**How do you deal with the drop in temperature in the fall?**

It's been pretty off and on in terms of hot and cold. So in that case, if I'm wearing shorts, I'm going to wear a warmer top, like a long sleeve or maybe a sweater, usually with a shirt underneath. We tend to have really clear skies in California, so we get really hot weather during the middle of the day, and as soon as the sun sets, it starts to get really cold, really quickly.

[img416 fullwidth]

**What do you look for in a sweater?**

I really love bell sleeves right now. So finding a crop that has a high neck and bell sleeves – that's something I'm looking for right now. Typically, a sweater kit is pretty basic, so if you can accentuate it with small things like a bell sleeve, it brings it to a whole 'nother level and really makes an outfit. For the most part, I feel like people pair sweaters with an outfit that's already in mind.

**Most hated trend:**

I hate creepers – the shoes. When I see them, I'm just a little overwhelmed by them. I think they're a very fast trend and that they're going to die out pretty quickly. That brings up a point that I like timeless pieces. I like classic stuff that transcends different generations of fashion.

**Where do you shop for clothes?**

I do a lot of online shopping. For me, I like having everything that I know is going to be in the store available. I've been to different Zara's in different locations – just for the example of Zara – and I would look online for a dress I wanted, and it wouldn't be located in one location but it would be located in another, and sometimes it's inconvenient. I like to go online because I know everything's going to be available. It's just becoming easier and easier every day to shop online in terms of shipping, etc. Things get here quicker, and you know they're coming straight from the warehouse, so it's going to be the highest quality.

**Have you done anything at UCLA related to fashion?**

Most of my internships have been related to my major and my minor, geospatial informational systems and technologies, but I've been involved in two particular organizations that fostered my interest in fashion. The first is the group called Fashion and Student Trends. One of my best friends, she graduated a couple years ago, was one of the designers and she told me about it and encouraged me to try out for modeling. I did just for fun and ended up doing the fashion show at the end of the year. I didn't wear her styles, but I wore one of the other designers. That was a really fun experience, and you learn a lot.

I also did the Hammer Student Association. A lot of the people in that organization were fine arts majors, Design | Media Arts majors, and they were all just really creative people, and even though we weren't directly working with fashion, they really cultivated an inspiration for aspects of design, so I became really interested in that.

**Are you hoping to pursue a career in fashion?**

Ultimately for me I want to be a geospatial data scientist, but I will always be very invested in knowing what current trends are because I love them so much. Even though I'm going to be doing something else in my career, it's just a passion I have that I think really helps balance parts of my life that are maybe a little more technical versus enjoyable.

[img417 fullwidth]

**How would you describe your style?**

I like mixing eclectic pieces with simpler items. I don't find myself wearing prints that much. I just wear simpler clothes and then accessorize to make it more fun. It's pretty classic, not too crazy.

**What do you look for in a sweater?**

I think first it needs to be very soft and comfortable because I don't like an itchy sweater. I think the cut of it is very important because sweaters can easily add on a couple of pounds if they're not cut correctly. I just make sure that they hang from your body right. I'm more into solid colors and stripes. I definitely find myself leaning toward that. I like sweaters with a lot of texture.

[img419 fullwidth]

**Most hated fashion trend:**

I hate Tevas. For a while people just started wearing Tevas. Can you just stop? I hate them. I think they're bad.

**Where do you shop for clothes?**

I shop online, but I actually never buy clothes online, unless it's just the only place you can buy them. I get an idea as to what's out there online and go to the store in person to try them on and feel the fabrics. I like going to department stores like Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's, and I also like going to boutiques where you can find something that's one of a kind. I really hate when people wear the same thing as I do.

[img420 fullwidth]

**Have you done anything at UCLA related to fashion?**

I had my first internship my sophomore year with Diesel. I was in the public relations department. It was fun – I just didn't really enjoy the PR side of it. I was an assistant stylist for these two sisters who have their own fashion label called Elkin Collection. They're really good friends with Emma Roberts, so I was an assistant stylist for different shoots that Emma Roberts was in, like Levi's, BaubleBar and People magazine. I had an internship with Lawren Howell, who was a contributing editor for Vogue. Now, I have an internship for WhoWhatWear – which is an online magazine – as an editorial intern.

**Are you hoping to pursue a career in fashion?**

I for sure want a career in fashion – I don't exactly know what I want to do. Before my WhoWhatWear internship, I thought I wanted to work for a fashion magazine. Now at my internship I just don't really like it. I'm behind a computer all day long, and I don't think I'm a very stationary person. I just want more a more exciting job, so I'll figure that out later on – what I want to do.",30,""

## Tips from my kitchen to yours

- You can find rennet and citric acid powder at Whole Foods Market for $13.
- Milk: Stay away from ultra high temperature (UHT) pasteurized milk. This method of pasteurization denatures the proteins in the milk, preventing them from being able to fully solidify into curds. Whole milk will produce a very rich, soft mozzarella. One percent will make a harder, more string cheese-like cheese. Avoid fat-free milk, as this will make the cheese too rubbery. Raw milk is the best option, though it's typically hard to find.

# Ingredients

- 1 ½ teaspoons of citric acid powder
- ¼ teaspoon liquid vegetable rennet combined with 1 cup water
- 1 gallon of milk: whole, 1 percent or 2 percent, not UHT pasteurized
- 1 teaspoon salt

# In your kitchen

- Large sauce pot
- Slotted spoon (preferably metal)
- Cooking thermometer (ideally with a probe)

[img146 fullwidth]


1. Sprinkle the citric acid powder (after crushing the tablets) into a cool, large stockpot. Pour ¼ cup water over it and stir to dissolve.

2. Pour the milk into the citric acid solution and stir to combine. [img147 fullwidth]

3. Put the pot over medium-low heat and heat it to 90 degrees (use an instant-read thermometer). You may notice the milk beginning to curdle – this is a good thing.

4. When the milk reaches 90 degrees, remove the pan from the burner and pour in the rennet mixed with water.

5. Stir the mixture with a gentle, circular up-and-down motion for about 30 seconds, then use the spoon to stop the motion of the milk

6. Place the lid on the pot and leave it for five minutes. After five minutes, the mixture should resemble a very soft custard.

7. With a knife long enough to reach the bottom of the pot, cut the curd into a 1-inch checkerboard pattern, making lines across, then lines perpendicularly.

8. Return the pot to the burner over medium heat and stir it gently until the temperature of the whey (the liquid that separates from the curd) reaches 105 degrees.

9. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the curd to a colander placed over a bowl.

10. Slowly spin around the colander to allow the whey to drain from the curd.

11. Remove the curd and gently squeeze it a few times to drain away excess whey.

12. Transfer the curd to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it on high for one minute.

13. Remove the bowl from the microwave and pour off as much whey as you can. You can preserve all the excess whey and use it to make bread or add it to beverages to make them higher in protein.

14. Press the curd together with your hands and again drain away the whey that comes out.

15. Microwave the curd again on high for 35 seconds, then press it together to drain more whey.

16. Knead and stretch the curd a bit to drain more whey, then microwave it one last time for 35 seconds. [img148 fullwidth]

17. Knead in the salt and roll it under itself until it forms a neat ball. Then place the ball into an ice water bath and let it rest there until cool. [img149 fullwidth]

I thought I understood my Jordanian-American-Christian identity until last winter break, when I found out my dad used to be an anti-religious communist who secretly took a year off his schooling in the USSR to fight in Lebanon alongside a Palestinian group circa 1981.

Casual, I know.

We were walking our dog when he subtly mentioned that one time he was approached by wild dogs in Lebanon, but ""They didn't do anything, son, and I had weapons with me."" I, of course, had to ask why he'd ever needed to carry weapons in in the first place.

""Honey,"" he asked in Arabic, turning to my mother. “Haven't we told him that story yet?""

This ""story,"" of course, was a jolt, considering it came from the mouth of my now very pacifist, very Christian father. The same father who serves my friends fruit and tea when they come over, and who surprised me with a message in my iPhone's Notes app when I came home from UCLA one weekend: ""I love you my son when you come back.""

So an anecdote about fighting Israeli forces? Not so casual, baabaa.

Grappling with stories like this is tough because I’m both Arabic and Christian, two identities that don’t normally mix.

As a family, our Arab denunciation of injustice done to Palestinians has often found itself at odds with a Christian (and, often, American) respect for Israel. With this conflict, I've always been in limbo, neither here nor there, not knowing where to stand on divisive issues or with whom to associate myself.

It’s been like this for as long as I can remember.

Born in Amman, Jordan, in 1994, I came to California as a bright-eyed 4-year-old who soon attended an American, Lutheran preschool on weekdays and an Arabic-speaking church on weekends. I went to public school from kindergarten onward, but that didn’t make me any less confused about culture and faith.

At 8 years old, I attended Calvary Chapel, an American megachurch in Costa Mesa, in addition to my family's original Arabic church – sometimes alternating Sundays, sometimes attending both in the same day. By then, I had started to notice small, nagging anomalies in how I viewed myself.

At my Arabic church, we held an annual Day of Prayer for the Arab World and the U.S. I saw images of congregation members' homelands being torn apart and churches bombed. On potluck days, my relatives would often bring traditional Arabic pastries that corresponded to cultural holidays, sometimes Muslim ones.

At the American church, I was told to pray for Israel. Sunday school teachers pointed to passages like Isaiah 43, which proclaim that Israel is “precious in (the Lord’s) sight.” In similar stride, they’d point to the New Testament, which notes that ""salvation"" (an obviously critical part of Christianity) ""is of the Jews"" (John 4:22).

Something didn’t fit. The two calls to prayer weren’t mutually exclusive, but the emphasis on each side was.

In which way was I supposed to pray?

The problem here is rhetorical. Christians in the Middle East are a minority, comprising [5 percent of the region’s population](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11509256), according to BBC. Christians in the U.S. are a majority.

[img316 fullwidth]

I found myself leaning toward my American-Christian side, favoring a culture I saw as easier to adapt to and less archaic. At American church, we sang fun songs and talked about Jesus; at Arabic church, we had to hear sad stories about the state of our homeland.

My naive facade started to crack in middle school, when I heard of Palestinians who suffered as a result of Israeli settlements. My uncle – who married my dad's sister – is one of them. A now-Christian who grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, he credits his survival to people like Yasser Arafat, leaders who fought for the Palestinian cause. And while he concedes to the biblical support of Israel, my uncle has trouble supporting the Israel of today.

My uncle’s father was shot in Lebanon before his eyes. After the event, Arafat ensured the relocation of my uncle’s family from the refugee camp to better housing in Beirut. So while Arafat often used terrorist tactics which I can’t condone, to refugees like my uncle, he was a hero.

In ninth grade, I was assigned an essay about a human rights activist I felt I could relate to. Inspired by my uncle’s story, I tried writing the essay on Arafat. I was shaken writing it – I wanted so badly to understand my uncle, but my experiences in American church left me feeling detached and confused. I felt bad when I couldn’t understand the Israeli-Palestinian situation, and worse, that I couldn’t relate.

That same year, I was elected president of my freshman class, and I organized a bonding event for members of our associated student body class committee. For the event, I picked up a few pepperoni pizzas from Costco, to the delight of most and to the disappointment of two Middle Eastern, Muslim classmates of mine who couldn't eat pork. I apologized profusely for my lack of religious awareness, but it wasn't enough to prevent me from being vilified via instant message when I got home.

""You're a dirty racist pig,"" one of my classmates told me that night. ""I should've thrown you into a trash can when I had the chance.""

For an Arab, regardless of religion, Muslim culture is very much a part of life – and I couldn't believe I hadn't been aware of that critical part. I'd never felt less Arabic in my life.

***

[img318 fullwidth]

The next several years became an effort to understand my own culture. It meant that I invited my high school friends over for Jordanian meals like mansaf (a rice dish with meat and yogurt broth traditionally eaten with your hands), and when I got to college, I chose to fulfill my UCLA foreign language requirement with a year of Arabic.

In that Arabic class, I learned an interesting tidbit of information: The Arabic word for the West, al-gharb, bears the same root of the word for strange – ghareeb.

I couldn’t help but feel that Christianity had made me Western and estranged. Which is funny, because Christianity itself is inherently non-Western. It originates with Jesus, very much in the Middle East.

I began to wonder how we had reached a point in which two nonconflicting identities had become “strange” to each other. The answer may lie in how American culture views the Middle East.

The more I look back at my childhood, the more I cringe at how simplistic the American perception of the region is, often reeking of patronizing Orientalism.

In elementary school, I learned that the Middle East is important for two reasons: ancient Egypt and oil.

In seventh-grade world history, the history of the Middle East was taught almost exclusively as the history of Islam.

In 10th-grade AP European history, the Middle East was the Ottoman Empire, and then later, the pawn of imperialism.

In college, the Middle East is the talk of university divestment, tumultuous uprisings and debates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Sometimes, Arabic is a cool language to use for tattoos.

[img320 fullwidth]

What’s missing?

The familial-centered culture of hospitality. Food that extends beyond the scope of Sabra hummus eaten with pretzels and carrot sticks. The plurality of ideas, faiths and peoples in key cities and trade routes that shaped this “cradle of civilization.” The history in ruins and monuments, and even in the very landscape itself – the Jordan River, the Dead Sea.

This is lost every time I watch nightly news about President Barack Obama visiting the Middle East, while video clips of bombs and explosions dance in the background. This is lost every time ""Arab"" is unequivocally met with mentions of Islam and of violence, as if being Arabic must involve both – or worse, that the two must be related.

It might just be me, after all. I did grow up with a father whose identity I need multiple breaths to recite.

Christian, communist, fighter, pacifist – yet my dad still happens to be the most Arabic man I know.

And I’m my father’s son.",14,""

There’s a lot to see in Washington, D.C. Museums, monuments, people who look like they could be famous politicians.

There’s also a lot to be in Washington, D.C. Each morning, the sidewalks are packed with every kind of person imaginable. The suits on their way to Capitol Hill, the khaki-and-hoodie-clad kids on their way to a think tank startup, the less easily identifiable but still very important-looking professionals.

For me, Washington, D.C., is the place to start becoming an adult.

I’ve started opting for black coffee over sugary latte concoctions, swapped out running shoes for heels and take more than five minutes to get myself ready for the world every morning.

I’m also living in a new city, across the country from where I grew up and went to college, working an almost full-time internship at 60 Minutes and figuring out what I want to prioritize once I put on that cap and gown come June.

Just last night, I took a run down Pennsylvania Avenue after work. I know how that sounds, but Pennsylvania Avenue is one of two running routes I have – the other being Constitution Avenue. It’s very Washington, D.C., I’m aware.

Anyway, I felt undeniably “House of Cards” running in the dark, the illuminated dome of the Capitol glowing in the distance. I took a left at the White House and ran past Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., with all its bright lights, American flags and subtle foreboding. A few blocks later I pulled up outside the Newseum, feeling less Claire Underwood and more Hannah Horvath in terms of TV characters who run.

On the smooth facade is carved one of many quotes: “Freedom includes the right to be outrageous. Responsibility includes the duty to be fair. News is history in the making. Journalists provide the first draft of history.”

That idea is grand and self-serving, but also kind of intoxicating. Does that quote apply to any of my work to date? No. Does it apply to what’s going on in the world right now? Definitely. The dichotomy between those two answers currently epitomizes a dilemma in my life – the gulf between where I am and where I want to be.

We can revisit this topic in March and I might very well be hyperventilating, but at the present moment the idea of the future is exciting. But as I clearly spend a good deal of time thinking about it, there’s a lot I’m going to miss once college becomes the past.

Moving away from LA – which after two months in Washington, D.C., is something I’ve decided I want to do (see: “House of Cards” runs down Pennsylvania Avenue) – won’t be easy. I keep dreaming up various schemes in which I convince all my friends to move to the same East Coast city as me. Texting and Skyping isn’t the same as flopping down onto a couch in the Daily Bruin office and venting about life’s every injustice.

This is also the first time in three years I’ve worked in an office that wasn’t run by students. Where my coworkers weren’t also my best friends and the people I spent all hours with, even when we weren’t in the office.

I’ve also thought a lot about what I’ll take with me from college – what did I really learn? As most Daily Bruin staffers will tell you, the most impressionable lessons occurred in that student-run office, not necessarily a classroom. It’s crazy to me that in return for working too many hours a week and for caring too much about our student paper, I might gain access to a career where I can continue to work too much and care too much.

I was asked to write about my experience “abroad” for this piece. I guess my time away from campus has a lot to do with all the time I spent on campus, as well as everything I hope comes next.

Instead of pursuing traditional quests, some protagonists grapple with complex everyday issues, like fear, alcoholism and morality, which cannot be easily resolved in a six-hour video game. The archetypical video game hero is substituted with average, relatable characters and a less linear plot. Playing these games, you might not always save the world, but you will certainly navigate the complexity of human emotion.


# Classroom Aquatic
- To be released by the end of 2014

[img187 fullwidth]

[img183 right]

The idea was spontaneous – someone blurted out that dolphins are smart and humans are stupid. Add the concept of cheating and throw in a new piece of virtual reality technology, and Classroom Aquatic was born.

Classroom Aquatic is a humorous stealth cheating game created during an Oculus Rift game jam last August by a group including UCLA alumni. In the game, you are a human diver who is in a school of dolphins – literally. Your goal is to do the best you can on the multiple-choice quiz your dolphin professor gives you, and judging by the impossibly hard questions it asks, your best bet is to sneakily look at the other students' tests for guidance.

What sets the game apart is its use of the Oculus Rift – a virtual reality head-mounted display. While wearing the device, you can pivot to look around and see other dolphins’ tests, even leaning forward to try to get a better view.

When released, the game will feature a full story mode that places the player in a variety of situations, from sabotaging science fair projects to going to prom with two different dolphins. The game will hopefully serve as a morality tale about cheating, thrusting individuals in a situation and having them comes to term with the actions they have taken, said Remy Karns, a graduate student at USC responsible for the production and writing of the game.


# Papers, Please
- Released in 2013
- Made by Lucas Pope
- For the computer
- $9.99
- Difficulty: Hard

[img185 fullwidth]

Papers, Please places you in the role of an immigration agent on the border of Arstotzka, a fictional communist country in the 1980s. Since you have won the position from the job lottery, your extended family is relying on you to support them. Every day you trudge over to the border, where you inspect the variety of people trying to enter the country. In the beginning, you simply have to inspect a passport and deny all foreigners. As the days pass, bureaucratic pressure mounts and you are faced with growing amounts of documents to sort through to determine if someone should be allowed to enter Arstotzka.

The game is hard, offering very few directions early on, and stark, simple graphics help drive the straightforward mechanics of the game. Very quickly, the core conflict of the game becomes keeping you and your family alive. As you struggle through your job, you are constantly faced with ethical dilemmas. A guard asks you to detain more people, offering a kickback every time you do so. Various entrees offer to pay you money. Others beg you, pleading to not be separated from their spouses. Then, a rebel group secretly contacts you to help overthrow the current regime.

[img186 fullwidth]

The game forces you to make difficult decisions. Cutting back on expenses like heat and food will leave your family more susceptible to illness – and in need of costly medicine. Conversely, accepting the bribes, kickbacks, and other actions might leave a sour taste in your mouth. The combinations of these decisions result in 20 different endings. These ethical decisions and the grinding monotony of the gameplay are what empower the game’s social commentary.


# Papo & Yo
- Released in 2013
- Made by Minority Media
- For the PS3 and computer
- $14.99
- Difficulty: Easy

[img191 fullwidth]

Papo & Yo is a fantasy adventure game where the player controls Quico, a young Brazilian boy as he explores a fantastical favela, or Brazilian shanty town, that he discovers while hiding in his closet away from his alcoholic and abusive father. Overall, the game is short, offering maybe five or six hours of gameplay with limited replayability, but employs a strong narrative to guide the player through the game.
Quico soon teams up with Lula, a toy-like robot that serves as Quico’s jetpack, and Monster, a large pink monster that resembles a rhinoceros. Despite his looming shadow that chases Quico early in the game, Monster initially serves a rather comic role. Quico can trampoline off Monster’s belly while Monster sleeps to reach distant locations. Many puzzles involve luring Monster to different locations, using food as bait to have Monster solve a variety of puzzle challenges.

[img192 fullwidth]

Even though Monster seems benign, Quico discovers that Monster is addicted to eating large green frogs nearly the size of Quico. When Monster eats these frogs, he lives up to his name, stampeding, spurting fire, and pursuing and attacking Quico. His first transformation is unexpected.

Once this discovery is made, the bulk of the game involves Quico and Monster questing to find the shaman who can cure Monster of his addiction. As the game progresses, the story slowly parallels Monster with Quico’s alcoholic father. While subtle at first, this connection becomes increasingly apparent as the game ends, transforming the game from a childish exploration of a magical favela to a navigation of Quico’s relationship with his alcoholic father.

# Bastion
- Released in 2011
- Made by Supergiant Games
- For the Xbox 360, computer and iPhone ($4.99)
- $14.99
- Difficulty: Medium

[img190 fullwidth]

“Now here’s a kid whose whole world got all twisted, leaving him stranded on a rock in the sky.” So the narration for Bastion, an acclaimed action role-playing game, begins in the aftermath of a huge catastrophe called the Calamity. The world was just destroyed and the main character, a nameless kid, finds himself alone and the entire population turned to statues of ash. The Kid heads to the Bastion, an emergency location that everyone agreed to go to if something happens. There, he discovers one other person who survived, named Rucks, who sends the Kid off on a quest for crystal cores to power the Bastion.

[img188 fullwidth]

The entire game is narrated by Rucks, whose country-western drawl guides you through the game, driving the story through a world filled with vibrant colors and a hand-painted feel. While exploring, the Kid meets two other survivors, Zulf and Zia. With these four dramatis personae, the game slowly evolves into a story not just about survival, but also reconciliation of the racial hatred and tension from a war 50 years ago. As the Kid, the player is given a chance to try to bridge this gulf between the two races as he discovers the mysterious cause of the Calamity.

[img189 fullwidth]

Replaying Bastion allows for tackling additional challenges and delving into the backstory of each of the characters. You can actively modify how hard the game is by invoking a pantheon of idols to buff the enemies. The buffs range from giving the enemies regeneration to increasing their speed.",3,""
62,7,Letter from the Editors,letter-from-editors,prime/winter-2015/lead/letters_3.jpg,Letter from the Editors,"Dear readers,

College has often been used as a synonym for self-discovery. On this campus, we have four years to supposedly figure out who we are – what we believe in, what we value and who we want to be. Of course, that’s easier said than done.

As students, our history and our passions are very much intertwined with our identity. Who we are is not only where we came from, but also what we love and care about.

Despite the hopes and dreams we have, the path to personal growth can often be fraught with fear and judgment, the self-loathing and uneasiness so often characterized by young adulthood. Still, we persevere – taking new risks and making new discoveries in hopes of honing our sense of self.

The stories inside this issue of prime mirror that sentiment. From deeply personal examinations of the ways culture impacts identity to explorations of the things that drive us – like magic, biology or fashion – every story found inside these pages champions individuality.

As editors, we’ve begun to find new and exciting ways to shape prime’s identity and purpose. The stories in this issue mirror that evolution.

This magazine tells the tales of people who thought outside the box, who defied convention and had fun along the way. We’d like to think we’ve learned from them, and we hope you will too.

Rumor has it that the founder of Bay Cities Italian Deli and Bakery in Santa Monica was a retired Chicago policeman on the run from the mafia.

Antonio DiTommaso was told it was in his “best interest to move out West,” according to deli lore, said Hector Padilla, general manager at Bay Cities.

To escape any kind of retribution, DiTommaso picked up his life and moved to California, leaving police work behind for customer service. In 1925, he transformed a storefront on Lincoln Boulevard into a deli where Angelenos could get their Italian sandwich fix.

Padilla said the shop has gone through five different owners since DiTommaso.

Today, 90 years later, in a location next door to the original one, the sandwich counter is as busy as ever, and the small storefront on Lincoln Boulevard has grown into a mecca for gourmet cheeses, hundreds of olive oils, balsamic vinegars and every conceivable topping for a hearty Italian sandwich. Although the deli and its clientele have significantly expanded since it opened at the beginning of the 20th century, the deli has maintained a friendly, bustling neighborhood atmosphere.

And Padilla takes great care to make his customers feel at home. Whether you’re a new customer or a regular, he’ll pat your shoulder and point you toward something in the shop he thinks you’ll like.

“This is like my living room, and all these people are just coming in to visit,” Padilla said.

Indeed, it is like Padilla’s home away from home. He and several of his family members – his uncle, aunt and their four children – work at the deli with him.

He even makes Los Angeles celebrities feel like part of the family. He said he’s seen dozens of them come and go throughout his nine years at the deli, and a few are close friends.

Dustin Hoffman, who told Padilla he was normally a tequila man, went through a change of heart at Bay Cities. At Padilla’s suggestion, he tried the shop’s Glenmorangie Nectar D’Or single-malt Scotch, and now it’s his regular purchase. Hilary Swank, Ramon Martinez and Joe Montana are some of the many famous, familiar faces at the deli.

Padilla said although he loves helping and joking with celebrities at the deli, his favorite customers are pregnant women.

When he sees a pregnant woman come into the shop wide-eyed and starving, he pulls her aside and gets her order.

“Now I see some of their 3- and 4-year-old kids come in, and I’m like, ‘I remember you when you were in your mommy’s tummy!’ And they’re like, ‘What?,’” he said, laughing.

Bay Cities has more to offer than just your standard small-market fare. The shop offers specialty housewares – like crepe spreaders and ravioli stamps – that are hard to find elsewhere. The line for the deli counter – where you can find everything from meatballs to custom sandwiches – usually extends out the door.

[img317 left]

I tried the establishment’s signature sandwich – “The Godmother” – and two other specialty sandwiches, called ""The Spaniard"" and ""The Little Don Lorenzo.""

**The Godmother**

The Godmother, Bay Cities’ claim to fame since the 1950s, is definitely not for the faint of stomach. Plan on skipping breakfast before and dinner after if you wish to try it out, because that’s how long you will be full.

It’s a colossal mound of four kinds of meat – Genoa salami, mortadella coppacola, ham and prosciutto – stacked underneath provolone, mustard, mayo, pickles, stringy onions, spicy pepperoncini, lettuce and tomato.

The first bite into the deli’s freshly baked bread is a religious experience. It has just the right amount of crunch on the crust to ward off sogginess from the sloppy sandwich fillings, but not so much to suggest staleness. Its pillow-like, doughy center pairs beautifully with the spiciness of the mustard and peppers, turning down the heat when needed.

The deli bakery also sells loaves of bread inside the shop. The in-house baked bread was the brainchild of Padilla’s uncle. His uncle, the master baker of the family, started baking bread at Bay Cities around a decade ago so that the deli did not have to order it from an outside vendor.

The meat is what makes the sandwich famous. Four kinds of high-quality, rich and savory flavors combine to make a smooth, if messy, sandwich-eating experience. The peppers and mustard add spice and zing that keeps your lips tingling, but not so much spice as to overpower the meat and cheese flavors.

The Godmother, like any other mother, is lovable, but a little high maintenance. The fillings can be tricky, too: After my attempt to balance all the flavors in one bite, all of the meat, cheese and vegetables slid out of the sandwich in one fell swoop. Overall, though, it’s utterly satisfying.

Tip: Split a large The Godmother with a friend, and pair the sandwich with chips of your choice before washing it down with Italian soda.

[img321 right]

**The Spaniard**

After studying abroad in Salamanca, Spain, this past summer, Spanish sandwiches – called bocadillos – will always have a place in my heart. They are usually served on baguette-like bread with olive oil and thinly sliced jamón (ham) or some other kind of meat.

The Spaniard at Bay Cities is definitely a fancier take on the traditional bocadillos. It’s stuffed with Pamplona chorizo – from the city that hosts the running of the bulls festival in July – hot copa seca, honey ham, serrano, Gruyère cheese, plump roasted tomatoes, olive oil and a hint of rosemary. Parsley flakes dot the crust of the bread, which is a scrumptious loaf of mini baguette.

Compared to The Godmother, The Spaniard is much easier to eat because it has less sauce and fewer toppings. Using olive oil instead of mustard and mayonnaise lets the flavors of the Gruyère, chorizo and serrano really shine. The nutty quality of the cheese and the strong, savory meat left my mouth watering. If you’re in the mood for a simpler sandwich than The Godmother and you want to satisfy all of your Spanish meat cravings, go for The Spaniard.

**The Little Don Lorenzo**

The Little Don Lorenzo is every bit as cute as its name. Served on a small, twisted mini baguette with olive oil and spicy black pepper seasoning, the tasty sandwich is made of thinly sliced, lace-like Parma prosciutto, water mozzarella, chopped basil and roasted tomato. It’s quintessentially Italian.

The mozzarella is a standout in this sandwich. The rich, smooth and creamy cheese complements the drier, more robust smoky flavor of the prosciutto. The basil adds a refreshing seasoning to the juicy roasted tomato.

The Little Don Lorenzo was more comparable to the simplicity of The Spaniard than the intensity of The Godmother. But the sandwich was comfort food – familiar flavors, a delectable combination of meat and cheese and just the right size for a little lunch.

***

Padilla said he still does not know all aspects of Bay Cities’ past. Parts of its long history are secret – and parts of its menu are as well.

[img322 fullwidth]

The four ""off-the-menu"" items include ""The Godfather,"" a double-stacked version of The Godmother, ""The Don Lorenzo,"" an expansion of The Little Don Lorenzo served on the deli’s regular bread with caprese and Parma prosciutto, ""The Lt.,"" a sandwich with turkey and salami, and ""The Canine Nero,"" which includes tri tip, water mozzarella and balsamic vinegar and was named after a local police officer’s dog who died about a year after the officer became a regular at the deli.

Now when the officer and his pals come into the shop, they know to ask for The Canine Nero. And after nearly a decade of managing the store, Padilla loves that customers come to find sandwiches with personalities.

“I’ve stayed because of the food and the people,” he said.",13,""

25,5,Raw Vegan Diaries: Tips and tricks from a foray with raw veganism,raw-vegan-diaries,prime/spring-2014/lead/vegan_diaries.jpg,Reporter Madeleine Wright breaks down what it was like being raw vegan for two weeks.,"[img184 fullwidth]

My brother and I sat at an elevated table in the corner of a shabby Mexican restaurant. I desperately tried to not focus on the plate of steak, rice and beans in front of him; I tried even harder to not compare it to the small bowl of guacamole – my meal – in front of me. I again reconsidered what I had set out to do for the two weeks: to be raw vegan. The fundamentals of raw veganism are simple: fruit, vegetables and nuts only, nothing prepared above 118 degrees, eat a lot to keep you full.

Two years previously, I failed at vegetarianism. This spring break and the first week of the quarter I wanted to push myself as far out of my comfort zone as I could and see what raw veganism is all about. A week into my experiment, although I was not ready to commit to raw veganism, I was considering it. What I had previously considered to be incomprehensible, I now felt had merit – because I felt great.

# The easy and the hard

## Easy

1. The fact that the only food preparation you need to do is rinse fruits and vegetables before you eat them.

2. Days 5-14: You’re used to it now, and when someone walks past you with a panini or piece of pizza, you don’t salivate and instead chew your raw almonds peacefully.

3. How surprisingly easy it is to feel full of energy and happy.

4. Your skin when you don’t have any animal byproducts in your diet. Butter – an animal byproduct – is greasy. When you remove it from your diet, everything you eat is “clean,” and your complexion improves.

## Hard

1. Going to In-N-Out and realizing that even though french fries are technically vegan, they are off-limits because they are prepared above 118 degrees.

2. The first four days. You’re constantly snacking to supplement your normal food cravings, and that makes you feel bloated and sluggish. Once you get the remnants of your old diet out of your system, your eating schedule normalizes and everything gets easier.

3. Having the staples of your diet be salad, fruit and nuts – and their many offshoots.

4. Not drinking coffee. Coffee beans are roasted (above 118 degrees).

5. Feeling cold. The cooking-temperature max of 118 degrees is not that hot – at best, it’s lukewarm. When everything you eat or drink is cold, your body stays chilly.

6. Eating at restaurants, dining halls or anywhere that’s not out of your fridge.

7. Trying to break up the monotony of raw carrots and apples by getting creative. Creativity when it comes to concocting appetizing food is also a struggle.

8. Not owning a blender.

# Trend

Mandie Clark is the Westwood Whole Foods’ raw vegan chef. She’s in charge of the pop-up raw venues that appear Monday to Thursday, 12-2 p.m. and 5-7 p.m. and she stocks the raw foods shelf inside the store with her raw creations. Her cart houses the essential ingredients and end results of her cooking: The walnuts help create her version of a hamburger and the sunflower seeds serve as her taco “meat.”

A raw vegan for seven years, Clark said she’s now made a career out of it. Two years ago, Clark was working at Whole Foods in Venice, where the concept for a raw vegan venue was born. Six months ago, she was hired in Westwood as the official raw chef, making the Westwood and Venice Whole Foods locations the only two on the West Coast with raw vegan venues, Clark said.

Many of the people who approach Clark have heard of veganism, but say they need meat in their diet for protein and variety, she said. Clark tells them they just need to eat more fruits and vegetables to get enough protein, and any supermarket has enough variety for a raw vegan. After that, the necessary tools are a blender, knife and a cutting board.

“It’s taking that first step that people are scared of,” Clark said. “They might know about the trend of raw veganism because it’s more popular, but it’s still only growing.”

She said the raw trend began in magazines around 2004, and there are now more people reading about it online and seeing raw snacks in stores. These can be found inside the Westwood Whole Foods – raw granola bars, raw goji berries and raw chips have their own shelf. Clark attributes the increase in snacks to customer demand. “If a customer wants raw food, Whole Foods is going to get it for them.”

# How to do it

## Eating on your own

When you become a raw vegan, the first few days are the hardest. You’ll be snacking a lot, and depending on where you live or what your food plan is, you’ll want to make sure you’re prepared. I recommend having the following foods at arm’s length because when you’re eating raw, hunger comes on fast and oftentimes without warning.

## Staples

Apples – Very filling and easy to carry around.

Bananas – Super sweet so you won’t crave as much and easy to carry around. Also great for smoothies (if you’re blessed with owning a blender).

Cherry tomatoes – Delicious, juicy and conveniently tiny.

Raw almonds – Perfect for snacking, lots of protein and they will fill you up.

Dried cherries and raisins – If you get bored of eating raw almonds alone (and you will), pair them with dried fruits to make your snack sweeter. Make sure no sweetener is added to the fruit.

Carrots (full-size, not baby) – They will keep you full and are perfect for when you’re starving and the only convenient dipping sauce you are allowed to eat is raw hummus. Get a 5-pound bag.

Tangerines – Sweet and easy to carry. You can eat a bunch at once and it will satisfy your sweet tooth.

Grapes – They will refresh you and are crunchy and cool enough that they’re a nice switch from the go-to apples and bananas.

Berries – Although they’re expensive, it’s not as though you’re eating meat or sushi, so splurge on berries, which have great antioxidants and help boost your metabolism (raspberries especially).

Sprouted mixed beans – High in protein and chewy. When you want something that reminds you of the black beans you used to get at Chipotle, this is a good option.

## Life savers

Avocados – High in oils and fats, and one of the only things you can eat that is not fresh off the vine and obnoxiously crunchy. When you’re tired of an apple, this is a great snack that you can complement with cold-pressed olive oil, lemon juice and a grapefruit. Put it on top of some butter lettuce and you’re golden.

Sprouted garbanzo bean hummus – Not only is this the only ready-made substantial condiment you have access to as a raw vegan, but it’s a wonderful addition to the myriad vegetables you’re eating and helps add a new dimension to plain produce. My favorite is Majestic Sprouted Hummus from Whole Foods for $5.99 a tub.

Cucumbers – Add lemon juice and salt. Delicious.

Red onions – Unlike the majority of vegetables you will be eating that are mild and boring after a while, onions are pungent.

Raw almond butter – After years of consuming peanut butter, this is not my personal favorite, but try it with apples and bananas.

## Nekter

I discovered Nekter Juice Bar, located at 10912 Lindbook Dr., in Westwood and thought I had found a Los Angeles-themed offshoot of Jamba Juice. A tall, bearded man behind the counter handed a customer a very green juice. Upon closer inspection of its menu, I realized that everything – including the granola in its acai bowls – was raw. Everything. UCLA students get 15 percent off with their BruinCard.

The Toxin Flush (parsley, spinach, apple, lemon and ginger): The ginger was pungent (a nice change for raw vegans) but the apple was sweet enough to counteract the vegetables and make it mild, manageable and delicious.

The Pitaya Bowl (pitaya, banana, pineapple, coconut butter and coconut water): The raw granola gave it a cereal-like crunch that I had craved for the preceding week, and it was thick and sweet. And it was substantial, something hard to come across when you’re a raw vegan.

Bruin Bowl (acai, banana, raw vanilla bean, cashew nut milk and berries): It was less thick and filling than the pitaya bowl, but the combination of the fruit, granola and acai gave it a depth that can oftentimes be missing from a raw vegan diet.

## Nutrionist

Carol Chen, a dietician at the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center, would not recommend an exclusively raw diet to a college student because of the time commitment and planning necessary to guarantee balanced nutrition. She would recommend a “cherry pick” – a combination of raw and cooked foods that still allows someone to experience the benefits of raw veganism.

She said that by eliminating animal byproducts from their diet, people would consume less saturated fat and cholesterol and have high levels of magnesium, potassium, calcium and vitamin C – all nutrients that are high in plants – in their systems.

But, she added that certain nutrient levels, like that of B-12, a nutrient found mainly in animal foods and a necessary component to make blood, can decrease. In the case of B-12, a lack of the nutrient can lead to anemia. Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are other examples of nutrients found mostly in fish sources that are essential and whose levels suffer in a raw vegan diet, Chen said. Protein and calcium are also hard to come by.

To combat this, Chen suggests eating complementary proteins, like legumes and grains, which also help increase iron levels. If consumed with vitamin C, the absorption of iron from plant sources is more effective, she added. Taking a protein supplement or nutritional yeast powders, which contain high amounts of B-12, help round out the nutrition in a raw vegan diet, Chen said.

# My feelings afterward

After two weeks as a raw vegan, my first non-vegan meal of potato soup seemed unnatural. I had a knot in my stomach from the guilt, and 20 minutes later, I had another knot in my stomach because of the ingredients. At first, I thought it was because of how rich they were, but the next day when I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the feeling returned. It wasn’t healthy and I knew the feeling was partly psychological.

Being a raw vegan had become my routine and, for those two weeks, it had become part of my identity, too. It had consumed me, and if I wasn’t eating raw – which I now equated with “healthy” – I felt guilty.

As I transitioned back to a “normal” diet, I continued to come back to this feeling, and it wasn’t until the fourth day that I could look at a pretzel and not question myself. Just two weeks earlier, I had the same type of transition, and within a week, I felt great. As a raw vegan, I had energy, I was happy and I felt healthy. But it was a transition. Raw vegan, vegan, vegetarian, carnivore – any lifestyle takes time to adapt to, and that adaptation partly consumes you. So maybe you are what you eat? Living the other way for two weeks taught me doing the extreme was great, but it also taught me I couldn’t do it forever.

However, the individuals who do go raw vegan – and stay raw vegan – aren’t following the same trend I was following. For them, it’s not a trend or a diet – it’s their actual lifestyle. To call it anything else would not reflect the difficulty in adhering to a diet so strict. I now know I would crave a chocolate chip cookie, or get tired of chewing carrots after too long.

What I won’t get tired of is balance. Once your body adapts, it’s part of who you are – now I eat pretzels, and thank goodness, because they’re delicious. But now I also drink green juice, and that’s delicious, too.",8,""

Starrie Lowe, who has been the acupuncturist at UCLA’s Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center for two years, is comfortable with getting up close and personal. Her career involves breaking through both bare skin and inhibition in an attempt to heal every kind of ache and pain. Lowe is a third generation acupuncturist, carrying on the traditions of what she calls a path toward health.

Acupuncture is based on the belief that humans have within them a map of energy pathways. The energy, or chi, responds to a needle that causes physiological shifts within the body, Lowe explained. For instance, the shifts can ease the swelling and pain of a sprained ankle or reduce stress.

There are also certain organs – such as the heart, liver and lungs – that are associated with negative emotions being out of balance.

She pulled out a piece of paper with an outline of a human body filled with branching lines and rivers of color from head to foot. It represented the flow of energy and showed the location of important needle points.

“I see the body as a canvas,” Lowe said.

[img129 fullwidth]

She added that acupuncture is much more than just the needles. It is also about encouraging patients to improve their individual lifestyles.

“I always welcome any questions my patients have. I have thousands of years of ancient medicine and storytelling for support,” Lowe said.

***

Lowe always knew she was going to be an acupuncturist.

Her mother and grandfather owned an acupuncture practice and she said the children in the family grew up with the understanding that this kind of medicine is a way of life.

When they got sick as children, they were given herbal teas and ginger cabbage soup instead of medications to chase their fevers away. There were always acupuncture tools lying around the house and she said that, even at a young age, she enjoyed getting acupuncture from her family.

“For me, it was as natural as breathing. I felt connected to my culture and heritage, which is still a reason why I am inspired by this career today,” Lowe said.

She volunteered in hospitals as a student because she said she always wanted to see how she could integrate Eastern medicine into a Western setting. Lowe finished the four-year program at Emperor’s College in Los Angeles in 1997, earning her degree as a licensed acupuncturist. A few years later, she began supervising acupuncture interns at the Ashe Center and eventually became the official staff acupuncturist.

Dr. David Baron, the executive director of the Ashe Center, said acupuncture was introduced at the center in response to student requests. Doctors also suggested offering the treatment because they wanted to suggest it as an additional treatment for their patients, he said. He added that the validity and usefulness of acupuncture was scrutinized just as any other Western treatment would be before being offered to students.

Baron said in his own experience as a physician, he has noticed a gradual trend toward mainstreaming Eastern medicine and a greater acceptance of the methods because people are becoming more frustrated with Western medicine.

Doctors who practice Western medicine have been subjected to many changes in the structure of the health care system that strain their relationship with the patient, Baron said.

“You might see the doctor for maybe five minutes, and he doesn’t even sit down but he gives you a prescription for your symptoms,” Baron said. “You might be getting what you need to feel better, but you don’t. You feel like you’re in a factory.”

Patients are allotted an hour of one-on-one contact with Lowe – an amount of individual attention that is rare in Western clinics.


Although students come into her office with physical sprains and aches, she said she finds that a broken spirit caused by emotional or mental stressors oftentimes contributes more to a person’s poor health.

Lowe said she has found that many patients seek acupuncture at the Ashe Center for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.

Although the actual acupuncture treatment only takes about 20 minutes, the appointment can naturally evolve into a session in which she listens to grievances about school and relationships.

She said that people tend to feel comfortable sharing private information with her, possibly because they feel like acupuncture’s goal is to treat the whole person.

The consultation sessions before and after the treatment are equally or even more important because she advises the patient on how to improve his or her well-being on a very personalized basis, Lowe said.

Chris Rusak, a third-year art history student, said he tried acupuncture years before coming to UCLA because bad experiences with prescription medication made him want to try something more natural. Since then, he tries to get the treatment regularly to treat pain and increase his overall health.

He said he recently sprained his ankle and Lowe’s acupuncture treatment immediately reduced the swelling and pain.

“I feel like a lot of doctors will give you medicine to treat one symptom, whereas acupuncture treats the body as a whole,” Rusak said. “That makes more sense to me.”

Lowe and other clinicians said that it is important to remember that acupuncture does not replace Western medicine but can complement a patient’s health care experience.

“For example, if you have a strong migraine, it makes sense for you to take medication. But if these migraines are reoccuring, it might be because of neck spasms that can be eased by acupuncture,” said Dr. Ka-Kit Hui, the director of the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine.

***

Toward the end of one of our interviews, Lowe stopped and said she had been answering too many questions, and now it was my turn. She asked how my health was doing.

Before I knew it, I had become one of her patients, confiding in her about my own anxieties and doubts.

She did not stick needles into my body, but somehow just the advice she gave me started to make me feel better.",5,""
27,5,Receiving the Call: Former UCLA player Kevin Jordan finds new mission,receiving-call,prime/spring-2014/lead/football.jpg,"UCLA alumni and former student athletes Kevin Jordan and Jenny Johnson-Jordan return to campus as chaplains for UCLA athletes, bringing their journey full circle.","A group of about 30 UCLA student-athletes sits neatly on prearranged rows of chairs in a room in Pauley Pavilion. All eyes look ahead at football alumnus Kevin Jordan, who takes center stage.

Ephesians 2 is the topic for tonight’s meeting. It’s a part of the Bible that Jordan keeps close to his heart. In particular, verses eight through 10 – those were a few of the verses he first memorized as a young believer.

He gives a handout containing an interpretation of GRACE – God’s Riches At Christ’s Expense – and the gift of salvation, the same handout he received as a freshman at UCLA.

“I became a new man,” he says to the crowd of athletes, concluding his explanation on how the spiritual growth of his first year at UCLA changed him.

He looks into a crowd full of familiar faces that recognize how he and his wife, Jenny Johnson Jordan, have impacted UCLA Athletics through their roles as chaplains and life mentors.


# A new man

Kevin Jordan entered UCLA as a freshman in 1991 to play football and earn a degree. He graduated with a degree in sociology as an All-American and a UCLA career receiving yards and career receptions record breaker. He also left UCLA a better man.

He owed the latter to his mentor and football chaplain, Rod Hairston.

“Football was important, school was important, but balance was important for me and also my spiritual life,” Jordan said. “I really wanted to take some next steps and develop myself holistically, and our chaplain made himself available.”

As the team chaplain, Hairston would lead optional chapels for the football team. At the same time, he became Jordan’s guide through the unfamiliar world of college. Once a week, before practice, the two would sit inside an empty Pauley Pavilion to talk.

The topic was life; it could be about things that were going on at home or even about Jordan’s frustrations on the football field. Whatever the issue, Hairston would listen.

He wasn’t a coach determined to get the best out of a player. He wasn’t a teammate who wanted to work together to get the ""W."" He was a sympathetic ear whenever there were problems – he was a friend.

[img180 right]

“I knew that he was there to love me, to listen to me, to pray for me and to encourage me through my life,” Jordan said. “So that was really what got (me and my wife) started on this journey – the impact that people had in our lives as student athletes.”

Around the time of Jordan’s regular meetings with Hairston, there was a UCLA freshman volleyball player Jordan would often cross paths with. She lived in a nearby dormitory. They also had a class together. They even wore the same jersey numbers. But they never really knew each other at that point. That player was Jenny Johnson.

When they finally met a year later in 1992, it was through mutual friends. It didn’t take long for them to bond over what they shared in common, including Johnson having a spiritual and life mentor of her own in Natalie Nuce.

Their shared experience of having someone guide them spiritually would bring them together not only in marriage but also in an effort to continue the tradition of mentoring student athletes.

“The bottom line is I knew how much my life changed as a result of someone like myself being on campus, available for me to just share my life with,” Jordan said.

So they took the baton that Hairston and Nuce passed and ran with it.


# A home of their own

Jordan and Johnson Jordan never really left UCLA. Even after graduation, the duo would always come back to Westwood to visit old teammates and establish new relationships.

But at a certain point in their athletic careers, it was time for them to move on from Pauley Pavilion and the Rose Bowl.

Johnson Jordan traded the indoor courts for warm sand, making the transition from collegiate volleyball player to professional beach volleyball player.

Jordan, on the other hand, made his way up to the big leagues of football, signing with the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent. After half a season with the Cardinals and another half with the Cincinnati Bengals, Jordan found himself trying out for a third team, the Denver Broncos.

But after a training camp where he struggled with injury and ended up not making the cut, the newlyweds, who married during the 1997 offseason, decided to settle down in Los Angeles and focus on her dreams of going to the Olympics for beach volleyball.

“And so (it was) just like ‘you know what, be here in LA, this will be our base. You do what you do, and I’m here to support you,’” Jordan said.

With that, Jordan moved to their house in Los Angeles full time, no longer needing to be absent for months to travel with professional football teams.

One day while visiting UCLA, Jordan found the call he was looking for to the next chapter of his life.

When Hairston made the decision to move to a different ministry in 1998, Jordan’s experience made it seem like he was the natural person to step in and take Hairston's place.

When a former teammate reached out to him with the idea, it only took one session for Jordan to commit.

“Just being in that room that night, it was like a light bulb went off. I said ‘This is it; this is what I want to do,” he said.


# Trip East

Ten years into Jordan's career as a chaplain for the UCLA football team, a different opportunity came. 

Former UCLA football coach Karl Dorrell was released from the program. Since Jordan's position as chaplain was independent of UCLA Athletics and the team's leadership was changing, Jordan's position was no longer guaranteed. Then he received a call from the professional director of Athletes in Action, the athletic branch of Cru, with an offer to once again work in the NFL.

Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin had a vision for his team. He wasn't just looking for a team chaplain, he was looking for a family to integrate into the organization. That family would render spiritual services to players and coaches and also offer the same to significant others and children.

After initially wrestling with the decision to move on to new horizons, Jordan and Johnson Jordan decided to make the move to the Western Pennsylvania.

“It was a big faith decision for us to uproot after being in Southern California for so many years,” Jordan said. “But we really felt like in a strange way, this was a call for us to step out in faith and to go and serve in this particular role.”

The new experience came with new duties. Jordan would have to be a figure present in the locker room and at the sidelines. He would also hold Bible studies for the players and coaches. Meanwhile, Johnson Jordan would hold studies for the players’ and coaches’ wives and girlfriends. They’d even work together to conduct couple studies.

“I felt like, because we had that background of professional sports, we could obviously relate to them in some degree,” Johnson Jordan said.

The new experience with the Steelers was enough to entice them to stay a year more than they had initially committed. But at the end of the day, even with two trips to the Super Bowl, they wanted to come back to Westwood.

The process of returning to Los Angeles started with Cori Close’s hiring as coach of the UCLA women’s basketball team.

“When I had my press conference here, Jenny’s (Johnson Jordan) father, UCLA alumnus Rafer Johnson, was there,” Close said. “And he came right up to me after the press conference and says ‘Okay, now you have a job to do. Now you have to help me get Jenny back here to LA. ... I miss my grandbabies.’”

Close, who had known Johnson Jordan since their days of regular Tuesday lunches in 1994 and 1995, was able to convince Johnson Jordan to come back to the West Coast.


# Coming Home

It was the same UCLA, but this time was different.

The four years Jordan and Johnson Jordan spent in Pittsburgh meant that almost all the student-athletes the couple had built relationships with before coming back in 2012 had already graduated.

They had to begin the slow process of getting to know a new generation of student-athletes once again. This time, they would serve the community as the 4TheJourney ministry, a donation-run ministry named after the number the couple shared on the back of their jerseys during their UCLA athletic careers.

[img181 fullwidth]

They started anew, as the women's basketball chaplains. It was an opportunity that gave them a foot into the door of the lives of student-athletes.

“These kinds of opportunities just gave us more opportunities to get to know the student-athletes of today,"" Jordan said. ""Where I can see one of the girls walking around, I know who she is, I know her name and they know what we do on campus.”

From Close’s perspective, working with Jordan and Johnson Jordan was the right answer to giving her players a valuable resource that she had access to when she was a student-athlete. She wanted her players to have the option of talking to what she calls a “trustworthy, wise outside source that they could really lean on.”

When tragedy struck the UCLA Athletics community in September 2013 with the untimely passing of former football wide receiver Nick Pasquale, Close recommended Jordan to UCLA football coach Jim Mora. Jordan once again took on the role of spiritual leader of UCLA football.

“They needed someone who was close enough to the guys, that looked like the guys, that could relate to the guys, in their time of need,” Close said. “I told Coach Mora about Kevin and how Kevin’s one of their own – I mean, he’s a UCLA football guy.”

""Both Jenny and Kevin were Bruins, so they know the culture of this school, (the athletes) know they know dorm life, (the athletes) know they know the cafeteria, (the athletes) know they know all the ins and outs around here and have seen the change,” said Mike Buchanan, who works with Athletes in Action.

“That gives them a pretty good platform around here, and a lot of the coaches have a lot of respect for them too and that’s opened a lot of doors to help them do what they’ve been called to.”


# The new generation

Now, a year and a half removed from Jordan and Johnson Jordan's return to UCLA, the 4TheJourney ministry has become an integral part of the UCLA athletic community.

Two years ago, Jordan and Johnson Jordan formed a relationship with junior guard Madeline Brooks as team chaplains but, after working together for two seasons, her relationship with the couple has developed into something much more than what it started off as.

Now Jordan is scheduled to officiate the wedding between Brooks and her fiance, sophomore pitcher Cody Poteet.

“He has a younger daughter. In the way he treats his daughter, he just respects her and cares for her in a very special way,” Brooks said. “He does that in a similar light to us.”

Every day they continue to work toward impacting a new generation of athletes the same way their mentors once did them.

“They're not overly bearing about Bible, Bible. You can really relate to them too and they’re really easy to talk to about any situation, even about relationships or about your sport, because they both were athletes here too so they get it,” said women’s soccer junior defender Caprice Dydasco, who sought advice on juggling a busy student-athlete life from the couple not long ago.

Though they still don’t officially hold a position in UCLA Athletics, or even have an office, Jordan and Johnson Jordan's ""ministry of presence"" can still regularly be seen around Westwood, whether it’s at games, practices or even just outside the Acosta Athletic Complex, having a chat with student-athletes.

[img182 fullwidth]

The figurative doors to the 4TheJourney ministry are always open for any athletes who may need someone to counsel them. It doesn't matter if what they want to talk about is spiritual or personal.

As he steps into Acosta, Jordan jokes that this would be the place for a hypothetical office if he had one – it’s where the foot traffic is, he says.

“Whether you’re a star player or you ride the bench doesn’t matter, we’re going to build a relationship with you and come alongside you,” Jordan said.

They’re taking the UCLA student-athletes along for the rest of their journey.",0,""

Every school year is an evolution, a process of growth and learning. Sure, as college students, much of our studying is done in classrooms and libraries, the typical facilitators of education.

But college is far more than reading information off a page. Our time as undergraduates is spent in a process of self-discovery, of adaptation, progress, transformation and, ultimately, change.

And with another school year come and gone, that change is very much at the heart of this issue of prime.

From the challenges that transgender students face every day, to the evolution of movie theater culture in Los Angeles, to the shifting laws surrounding street cart vending and undocumented immigrants, each story is emblematic of prime's broader progression.

Over the course of this year, we've grown and changed as a magazine, honing our style and our tone, working to evolve our message.

But now it's time for us, as editors, to say goodbye. To pass on our version of prime to a new generation, who will help it continue to shine brightly.

Thank you for taking this journey with us. We will miss prime terribly.

Imagine you’re walking along, when all of a sudden you trip, fall and land in a ditch. You try to climb to get out, but your initial attempts are in vain. You just sink further. Before you know it, you’re at the bottom of a deep hole. You are alone and have no hope of coming out. You want to call out for help, but you don’t. You don’t know why, but you just feel like you can’t.

This is the best possible way I can describe my depression.

***

I didn’t learn about mental illness – depression in particular – until I took my uncle’s health class in my freshman year of high school. I’ll never forget how he described it.

He introduced depression as “the common cold” of mental illness simply because it is the most common one. As he went more in depth, he struggled to find the words to illustrate the disorder until he finally said, “It’s when you can’t find the joy in life anymore. Those little things that would normally make you happy each day, just don’t anymore.”

I let those words sink in. The rest of the class looked confused – but I wasn’t. I actually understood. I was beginning to realize what had been happening over the past two years of my life.

My depression began when I was in eighth grade. Life up until that point was, for the most part, normal and carefree: I had some friends, I got good grades, I was walking along.

Then I tripped.

***

It began slowly. At first, it was a few misunderstandings. I couldn’t understand how all my friends would be laughing and bubbly when I could barely force out a half-smile. I didn’t know why I couldn’t smile or be happy. I tried so hard – I tried to fake-smile and fake being happy, but I couldn’t do it.

It was frustrating. It seemed so easy; everyone else exuded happiness with seemingly no effort while I was having trouble simply faking a smile.

That frustration began to metastasize. I was an eighth-grade adolescent girl. I didn’t know what depression was. I didn’t know exactly how to express what I was feeling to others, mostly because I didn’t know what I was feeling. I was sad at times, happy at times, but just overall completely lost. So I did the only thing I thought I could do: try desperately to pretend like everything was OK.

When I entered high school as a freshman, it only became worse. I was constantly confused as to why I was the only one who seemed to feel like this. I remember being so angry with myself because I wasn’t happy. I’d think about all the other people much worse off than me – yet I was the one who couldn’t be happy.

By the middle of my freshman year, my frustration broke into self-hatred. I ended up taking it out on myself through self-injury. Cutting became a release for the inner battle that was constantly going on inside my head – desperately wanting to be happy and “normal” but not being able to achieve it.

For the life of me, I can’t remember what drew me to the idea of cutting. I just remember one day I started, and I couldn’t stop. It was addicting. Right after cutting, I felt a sense of delusional euphoria. But it was quickly followed by regret and shame, sinking me even further than I was before. However, I would continue to repeat this cycle in pursuit of a false sense of happiness. Deep down, I knew what I was doing was unhealthy and wrong, but it was all I had at the time.

For the next few years, my efforts to stop were a mixture of moderate successes and devastating failures. In the spring of my freshman year, I told a few of my friends about my self-injurious behavior. It wasn’t easy; in fact, it was one of the most difficult things I had to do. I told them in a moment of desperation, and at first, I was ashamed. But they were sympathetic and supportive, and telling them seemed to actually help.

They made me promise to stop, and I did for a while. For the first time in two years, I stopped sinking. I wasn’t moving up, but it was more progress than I had made alone. At the very least, I was stable.

[img443]

And then I fell further. I’m not entirely sure why. It could’ve been the fact that this was the start of sophomore year – the beginning of Advanced Placement and honors classes – and I was neglecting my mental health more than ever before and instead focusing on school. Or because I was spending increasingly less time with the same friends that I had confided in. I could speculate for hours. At the time, I didn’t understand why, but I knew I was sinking again.

I thought about, heavily considered and very nearly did try to kill myself. It wasn’t something I wanted to do – rather, it was something I felt I had to do. I was suffering in a silent battle with no end in sight. I specifically remember using some sort of delusional “logic” to deduct that the only solution was to end it all.

But seeing as I’m here today – a student at UCLA writing this column – I didn’t make an attempt.

Two of the girls whom I had told in the spring noticed a change in my behavior around the time I was contemplating my death. They insisted that I get help, and later that day, I did. I did this because I truly didn’t want to kill myself. I wanted help and I wanted to be better, but I just needed an extra push.

Within one afternoon, I told my mom, went to a therapist, was diagnosed as “severely depressed with suicidal tendencies” and was put on an antidepressant in conjunction with therapy.

It took a couple years before I felt “normal” again. And even today – more than five years after that day – I still at times feel depressed and alone. However, this is not how I spend the majority of my time. The recovery from depression is an ongoing process, filled with ups and downs. I have been back to therapy and back on medication, but I’ve also had some of the best experiences of my life. I was accepted to UCLA, I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, and I’ve seen the sunrise over Half Dome in Yosemite National Park – just to name a few. I have learned to enjoy the good times as intensely as I can and take the not-so-good ones as a passing phase. Because there will be a next day, and there will be a better day.

***

Like the common cold, there isn’t a definite “cure” for depression. Even worse, depression is often treated just like a standard cold – as a nuisance, something you can just “get over.” Since no one had ever talked about it with me, that’s how I thought it was. Something you don’t talk about and needed to get over.

That was one of my biggest obstacles – this idea that I couldn’t talk about it. I didn’t think depression was a big deal because it was never something that was discussed. And if it was, it was in the context that people with depression were “crazy.” Therein lies the greatest problem surrounding mental illness – stigma. Individuals are stigmatized based on their psychiatric label of depression. There’s this idea that having a mental illness means something is inherently wrong with the person, rather than the disorder is affecting them. But there is also perceived stigma by the person with depression. This includes the internalized frustrations that people hold against themselves. Stigma is the greatest roadblock that prevents those who need treatment from seeking it.

In my experience, I mostly dealt with perceived stigma. I knew that something was wrong, but I didn’t know what it was. I didn’t allow myself to admit it for the longest time because I was afraid of the social stigma I would face.

My depression went undiagnosed for about two years. I didn’t seek help because I felt I was alone and would be judged for being depressed. Though I didn’t know it at the time, it was fear of stigma that stopped me from calling for help when I first became stuck in the hole. It was only after I overcame the stigma and finally discussed it with people I trusted that I became better.

And I’m not alone. According to a 2012 study, 44 percent of American college students report symptoms of depression. That means, on average in any given lecture hall on campus, almost half of the students have symptoms of depression – depressed mood, lower interest in activities or feelings of worthlessness. Depression – undiagnosed depression in particular – is one of the most prevalent risk factors for suicide. And suicide is currently sitting as the second leading cause of death among college-aged young adults (15-24 years old).

If someone is sick, we treat the illness. If someone’s stuck in a hole, we help pull them out of it. Why is it any different with depression?",46,""

West Hollywood is an enclave all its own.

The colorful neighborhood is nestled comfortably between the ultra-affluent Beverly Hills and Tinseltown itself, Hollywood. In many ways, WeHo – as it’s affectionately called – is a mix of its surroundings. The Beverly Hills glamour manifests in the trendy boutiques and eateries lining Melrose Avenue, blending seamlessly into the wild nightlife of the Sunset Strip and the sex shops along Santa Monica Boulevard.

And while much of what makes WeHo fun and exciting is priced well outside of a student budget – a night’s worth of dinner and drinks at Chateau Marmont is practically the same price as a quarter’s worth of books – the city hosts a wide range of cheap eats, fun shops and inexpensive activities.

Moreover as Los Angeles’ primary lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender enclave and the heart of the rock music scene from the 1960s onward, WeHo’s broader cultural significance cannot be understated. Where else could you find some of the most storied music venues in history – like the Troubadour – mere doors away from some of the most important LGBT cultural landmarks and educational centers?

But finding the more accessible parts of WeHo takes research, skill and a little bit of luck. Fortunately, prime has you covered – we’ve got the best spots, shops and eats for your buck. Spend a weekend immersing yourself in the different elements that make West Hollywood weird, charming and exciting.

No matter what part of WeHo you find yourself in, there’s always something good to eat.

Start off your day at Alfred Coffee and Kitchen, located on the tiny offshoot of Melrose Place. Inside the immaculately decorated hipster haven, you’ll find an otherworldly selection of coffee, tea, pastries and even pressed juice. It’s an ideal spot for an Instagram photo or a morning of celebrity watching.

Alfred exclusively brews connoisseur-favorite Stumptown Coffee Roasters coffee, and each drink is handcrafted to your specifications. Though perhaps best known for the “Alfred Cone” – a shot of espresso inside of a miniature ice cream cone with a chocolate rim – Alfred also has top-class pastries, with a lemon poppy-seed muffin coming in as the understated fan favorite.

Down the street, you’ll find the cheapest and most elite lunch spot in the city: ink.sack.

A sandwich shop with a school lunch theme (it’s named after sack lunches), the menu takes the best of high cuisine and slaps it on some bread.

[img329 fullwidth]

Don’t let the weird name deceive you. Owned by Michael Voltaggio, the ""Top Chef"" winner who was heralded as one of Food and Wine’s best new chefs of 2013 (a prestigious industry honor), ink.sack is a cheaper way to enjoy some of the finest flavors that his flagship restaurant, ink., located next door, has to offer.

Crowd-pleasers include Voltaggio’s take on the classic Vietnamese banh mi (pork shoulder, bacon, chicharrónes, pickled vegetables, onion spread, $6), the ""cuban"" (barbecue pork, ham, swiss, pickles, mustard, mayo, $6) and the ""cold fried chicken"" (house-made ranch cheese, Gindo's Spice of Life $5). Add a side of house-made salt and pepper chips ($3), and get ready to enjoy highbrow taste in a lowbrow format.


If you’re looking to get your dessert fix, there’s no need to look any further than next door. The neighboring storefront of ink.sack houses an L.A. legend: Sweet Lady Jane.

Named the best patisserie in the world by National Geographic, this cake-making powerhouse is beloved by celebrities from Oprah Winfrey to Ellen DeGeneres (whose wedding cake Sweet Lady Jane made). The shop's slices of cake are gigantic, so they’re worth the price. Split a piece of the famous triple berry shortcake with a friend, or try out the seven-layer mocha cake.

[img327 fullwidth]

Slightly north, on historic Santa Monica Boulevard, you’ll find more traditional grub.

kitchen24, named for the fact it’s open 24 hours a day, is a brunch classic, serving up the best breakfast potatoes – slathered in garlic and onions – in the entire city. While the line on weekends can often seem insurmountable (it can take upward of an hour, so come before you’re hungry), drop by during the week to take advantage of kitchen24's happy hour. It runs from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday.

Down the block, you’ll find a cultural landmark that’s good for a bite – Hamburger Mary’s Bar and Grille.

Sure, the hamburgers are good (with a name like that, they have to be), but Hamburger Mary’s is more than just a place to eat. An LGBT community icon, Hamburger Mary's has playful decor and stellar service that set the stage for a weekly event unlike any other: drag queen bingo.

## Shop around

[img332 fullwidth]

While most of the shopping in WeHo tends to be of the expensive, designer variety, there are plenty of cool places to go where you can afford to do more than just window shop. Take Kitson, for example. The celebrity-favorite boutique hosts more than its fair share of overpriced tracksuits and the like, but its knickknacks actually run fairly cheap, usually falling in the $20 or less range. Cool jewelry, home decor, books and more can be found at Kitson's flagship location in the heart of WeHo. The store’s bright, open-floor plan makes it easy to wander for ages, picking through the piles and piles of random, cool goods.

It’s a great place to stop by for a last-minute birthday gift too (their “nice Jewish guys” calendar is always a crowd-pleaser).

Up on the Sunset Strip, you’ll find Book Soup. This giant bookstore crams in everything from coffee-table books on French decor to mystery novels to leather-bound copies of Marcel Proust. Take a half hour and get lost among the aisles.

[img337 fullwidth]

But what makes Book Soup unique among the few remaining independent L.A. bookstores is its author events. Several nights a week, Book Soup features a different up-and-coming author for a reading and signing. Drop in to support the burgeoning local writing scene and discover someone new.

## Entertain yourself
***

Sure, much of the entertainment in WeHo is crowded into the Sunset Strip, where you’ll mostly find bars and clubs, or concerts with ticket prices that you can only dream of affording. But even if you can’t afford the price tag to go inside, storied rock venues like The Roxy Theatre or Whisky a Go Go can be fun to just look at and soak in the rock ‘n' roll history.

[img330 fullwidth]

If you’re looking for evening entertainment without breaking the bank, look no further than The Comedy Store. Most shows run at $20, but you’ll find big-ticket names playing almost every night. Louis C.K. just filmed his most recent comedy special there.

For more daytime fun, the Museum of Contemporary Art at the Pacific Design Center is a good place to start. Not only are the rotating exhibits always amazing, but entrance is free. The fashion exhibit currently on display is as weird as it is enthralling. Not to mention, this lesser-known outpost of MOCA is often quieter, and the architecture of the Pacific Design Center alone is enough to warrant a visit.

Although West Hollywood boasts plenty of other fun things to do, from concerts to nightlife and bars, the city’s true heart lies in its people. From the LGBT landmarks that dot the streets to the small Russian bakeries crammed into tiny storefronts, the city’s history continues to be shaped by the communities that call it home.

Walk around and explore.

23,5,A Bright Idea: Turning old light bulbs into decorative vases,bright-idea,prime/spring-2014/lead/Crafts Lightbulbs.jpg,Transform burnt-out lightbulbs into vases in seven easy steps. ,"[img132 fullwidth]

# Essentials

1. Thick gloves
2. Safety goggles
3. Long-nose pliers (the narrower the better)
4. Screwdriver
5. Old light bulb
Note: Do not use fluorescent light bulbs as they may release toxic chemicals when broken. 

# Recommended

1. String 
2. Hammer
3. Small, thin piece of metal (IKEA Allen wrenches are great)

[img138 fullwidth]

# Instructions

1. Put on safety gear and find a safe, open area. Very small glass particles will fly into the air, so an easily cleaned surface, like a towel, is necessary.
2. Use the pliers to peel off the little metal covering on the tip of the light bulb, revealing a small hole in the black plastic. [img133 fullwidth]
3. Wedge the point of the screwdriver into the little hole to break the black plastic. [img134 fullwidth]
4. Use the pliers to remove the now-cracked black plastic so you have access to the inside of the light bulb. 
5. Break the miniature bulb within the light bulb using a combination of the pliers, screwdriver, hammer and small metal piece. Recommended: Hammer with the small metal piece until the miniature bulb breaks, and then use the screwdriver and pliers to chisel away the remaining glass by twisting them at an angle within the neck of the bulb. [img135 fullwidth]
6. Use the pliers to pull out the wiring, leaving behind a clean, empty light bulb. [img137 fullwidth]
7. Add water and flowers and hang by a string.

The Thursday night crowd at Pasadena’s Old Towne Pub is small, but the sound pounding out of the opening band’s amps is deafening.

As the band plays its final discordant notes, a few more guests trickle in and order drinks at the bar.

Before handing the stage over, the opening act asks the crowd, “Who’s here to see the Urinals?”

Some family and friends applaud as Kevin Barrett, Rob Roberge and John Talley-Jones transition onto the stage.

“Apparently these guys are historical figures or something,” says a guest, leaning over. “I've never heard of them.”

[spotify]5g9utKqn0nJQr1MVvGbVCy[/spotify]

The Urinals began as a punk rock parody act during a UCLA Dykstra Hall talent show in the spring of 1978.

Five students came together with toy instruments, little-to-no prior music experience and only four to five practices under their belts to entertain their fellow floormates.

“We wanted to do two things: participate and subvert,” said Talley-Jones, the Urinals' vocalist and bassist. “We created a band specifically to be as assaultive – given our lack of chops – as possible.”

While some musicians from other acts weren't amused, most of the audience was in on the joke and appreciated the performance.

[img292 fullwidth]

The response was positive enough to encourage the group members to pursue punk rock and actually learn how to play and write their own music.

Three of the original five members stuck with the ragtag band and went into the summer of '78 with the intention of writing original punk material.

In the late '70s, the punk rock scene was less stagnant than it is now – the genre itself was still in infancy, and the scene wasn't associated with a specific sound yet. Punk, particularly on the West Coast, was still finding its shape.

“In those early days, everything was evolving,” Talley-Jones said.

Talley-Jones, drummer Barrett and guitarist Kjehl Johansen were searching for the band’s own shape as well, which would continue to change and adapt alongside the genre itself.

[spotify]7vehOyii6F4CtFjsF24IhQ[/spotify]

Halloween of 1978 was a fateful day for the Urinals.

Back from summer break and equipped with original material, the three students were ready to perform again. All they needed was an audience.

Their chance came during a Halloween party in Dykstra Hall. Every floor was hosting its own holiday activity, and the Urinals volunteered to have a concert in the fourth-floor study lounge.

The new songs were a bit rough and musically limited, but their length – short, a minute or two maximum – laid a framework that the band still follows.

“It’s an aesthetic choice. We wanted to write material that was geared to our limited abilities. It was one idea per song, stated efficiently in a brief amount of time. And then you’re done with that, and you move on to the next thing,” Talley-Jones said.

While the fourth-floor lounge was hardly an acoustic ideal, the band's performance still managed to stand out to one very important guest.

Vitus Mataré was in the audience, and he immediately took interest in the student band.

Mataré was the keyboard player for The Last, a band that had recently begun to gain popularity in the punk scene after being signed by Bomp Records.

To the surprise of the Urinals, Mataré eagerly offered to help record the band's first single at his pool house. The three members took the offer and, in do-it-yourself fashion, got the records pressed and distributed under their own label, Happy Squid Records.

Soon, the records began to make their way from punk fan to punk fan, even reaching the East Coast. But making a record didn’t spawn instant popularity – some listeners responded with confusion, even derision.

One response, from a listener in Florida, stood out: “Your record is about as musical as a dial tone ... or a pneumatic drill.”

[img293 fullwidth]

Despite some criticism, the record helped spread the band’s music, and those first few original recordings would eventually become the first four songs on ""Negative Capability,"" the Urinal’s first complete album.

With a single circulating, the Urinals began playing in UCLA venues like Kerckhoff Coffeehouse and practicing in parking lots and classrooms across campus.

The Urinals even crossed paths with an unhappy Chancellor Charles E. Young, who interrupted a practice in the Dickson Art Center (now the Broad Art Center) to let the band know it was echoing through Brentwood and into his house.

The band was also banned from playing at Ackerman Grand Ballroom after someone urinated in the grand piano after a show. The suspiciously named band was blamed despite its absence during the incident.

The band soon broke out of the UCLA scene and into Hollywood with help from Mataré.

The Urinals made their way along the Sunset Strip, opening for The Last as well as other significant early punk bands like Black Flag and even local favorites like the Go-Go’s.

The band quickly contributed more than just music to the scene, helping other fledgling bands it stumbled upon, like the Leaving Trains, play their first shows.

“Vitus did that for us, so that's what you’d do for other bands,” Barrett said.

Soon, Talley-Jones said, those bands had formed a microculture of their own.

[spotify]72oVzWeLswz2nPHmGE2LEV[/spotify]

As their sound evolved, the Urinals began to take issue with the image their name evoked.

“It seemed at that point that (the name) was starting to box us in. By the early '80s, everyone heard 'the Urinals’ and thought we were hardcore, but we were not hardcore,” Barrett said.

[img208 right]

The band soon changed its name to 100 Flowers in hopes of cultivating a new, broader image. The members stayed the same, but the music was more put together, with better songwriting and production.

A self-titled album was produced in 1983 with 16 songs – still short, but with a more sophisticated sound.

Unfortunately, the band split up a month before the album was released, citing creative differences. So despite its positive reception, there was no one to take the music forward.

[img197 right]

The individual members followed their own paths for 13 years and eventually decided to reunite, returning to the original ""Urinals"" name in 1996. The original lineup remained intact until Johansen left two years later. After a brief stint with an interim guitarist, the band filled the vacancy with a new guitarist, Rob Barker.

Barker, the guitarist on the band’s third album ""What is Real and What is Not,"" stayed until 2005 but left after the group returned from playing in a music festival in Beijing.

With the band once again missing a guitarist, Rob Roberge, a friend Barrett made after taking one of Roberge’s creative writing classes through UCLA Extension, expressed interest in playing with the Urinals. After some experimentation, the band started performing again and has maintained this lineup since 2006.

[spotify]61C5jhoGbczXIvjkrn7Siz[/spotify]

Each of the band’s three albums represents a different slice of its musical style – each showing a new evolution of its sound.

""Negative Capability,"" the first album, shows the early music – the songs themselves evolve over the course of the album. With so little musical knowledge back then, the band seemed to learn something new with every recording session.

The sound also evolved, simply because of changes in studio venue. The first set of songs was recorded with poor quality in Mataré’s pool house, the next at a Melnitz Hall sound studio and the last at a weight room in Dykstra Hall, the sound booming and the noise of one student still working out in the background.

""100 Flowers,"" the second album, illustrates a more musically capable slice of the band, each song having a more refined melody and rhythm, Talley-Jones said.

""What is Real and What is Not,"" the third album, was made after Johansen left the band and Barker took his place.

The fourth album – whose name is currently a secret – is set to come out in early 2015.

“Their sound has never stayed the same and it has always been unique. The band is always progressing and evolving,” said Danny Gromfin of Warning Label Records, who helped issue some of the band’s albums in collaboration with Happy Squid Records.

[spotify]31UUgJiklGiBjDl2R8yQde[/spotify]

Yo La Tengo, Butthole Surfers and the Minutemen are only a few of the names on a list Kathy Talley-Jones – John’s wife – keeps of the bands that have covered the Urinals’ songs.

[img205 right]

“We are constantly finding new covers out there,” Gromfin said. Gromfin keeps a similar list and exchanges names with Kathy Talley-Jones whenever a new cover pops up.

The names, spanning through genres and generations, show the influence that the band has on the L.A. music scene and music in general.

Although the band was one of many playing in Los Angeles in the late '70s and early '80s, its songwriting and music stood out to audiences and encouraged other bands to start and produce their own music, Gromfin said.

The age of the Internet also helped the band reach newer generations and kept its influence growing.

“A peculiar thing started to happen,” John Talley-Jones said. “We were discovered by subsequent generations of bands and people started to hear the material from back then. They found something resonant in the material that they really liked.”

This resurgence has even given the band the opportunity to tour internationally.

The band has toured in Canada and China because people heard its music and wanted the band to play at festivals or shows in their own countries, Talley-Jones said.

The Urinals’ latest tour was in Europe, where a fan and manager of London-based record label Harbinger Sound, Steve Underwood, set up the entire tour. The band played in France and Belgium in early November.

[img214 centered]

[spotify]3xtnvQAs5a1ArSl3WNameX[/spotify]

Rather than chase big contracts, the band members chose to take other jobs and pursue music without the pressure of it becoming a substantial career.

“We wanted to be able to play the songs we wanted and record them when we wanted. If that meant we had to have jobs, then we would have jobs,” Barrett said.

Each band member has his own career.

Talley-Jones was the medical book buyer at the UCLA Health Sciences Store for the past 12 years, though he retired a few months back. Barrett has been a data manager for an AIDS research study within the UCLA School of Public Health for the last 30 years, and Roberge is an author and creative writing professor at UC Riverside.

The choice to pursue more typical, nine-to-five careers was occasionally a source of frustration for the band members – keeping their performances and day jobs separate wasn’t easy.

“We had to juggle the band with our careers. You go on tour and then you come back to your cubicle,” Talley-Jones said. “You’re idolized for two weeks and then suddenly you’re just another cog in the wheel.”

But work was another aspect that defined the group.

“I think working has kept us honest, and it keeps things in perspective,” Talley-Jones added. “We know that this band is never going to be a multiplatinum selling act. That’s not why we do it. We do it because we love it.”",4,""
45,6,Letter from the Editors,letter-editors,prime/fall-2014/lead/primeINTROedit.jpg, ,"Dear readers,

Fall is a profoundly contradictory time for students. As the start of a new academic year coincides with the end of the calendar year, we’re torn between celebrating fresh starts and acknowledging inevitable endings.

This fall issue of prime magazine is no exception to that paradox. Although this is our first issue as editors – our own blank slate – the world of magazine journalism grows bleaker every day. We’re starting anew at a time when periodicals like this one are slowly but surely ceasing to exist.

And yet, prime is still here.

This issue of prime has unintentionally come to represent survival – both our own as a magazine, and that of others. Nearly every story on our pages, in its own way, represents the survival of someone or something.

From an incisive take on campus mental health to saving endangered public art to moving past the trauma of sexual violence – the stories in prime tell more than just facts and information. They tell tales of hope, strength, success and, ultimately, the ability to overcome.

And while there’s more to prime than just these stories – our lifestyle section has the best of winter fashion, fall bites and do-it-yourself dorm decor – they really are the heart and soul of our magazine.

It has been a profoundly rewarding experience editing this issue of prime. We hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed creating it.

Love,

118,13,Recipe: Cinnamon Buns,recipe-cinnamon-buns,prime/fall-2016/lead/web.prime. london.PicD.JessicaChan.jpg,"","[img526 fullwidth]

Four blocks away from my dorm, theater signs flickered brightly against the night sky for as far as I could see. For many tourists visiting London, Soho is where they go to see “Les Miserables,” or a place they wander around after visiting the British Museum. But for me, it was more than that. It was home.

Even as I got to know my neighborhood in the six weeks I lived there, it was still full of surprises. One afternoon, I discovered a street food festival that only happens once a year. Another day, I stumbled upon a bakery.

On a quiet side street in London’s Soho neighborhood, there’s Nordic Bakery.

I spotted the storefront’s thick white lettering as I turned the corner of Golden Square, and the scent of cinnamon filled the air before I fully stepped into the bakery. Once inside, I heard the slow whir of coffee being made, lingering conversations humming in the background and a steady flow of people in and out. Soon after, I had a cinnamon bun in hand, still warm from the oven.

When I was in the bakery, it no longer felt like I was in bustling London. It was a refreshing change of pace from passing quickly from one museum and monument to the next.

The cinnamon buns at Nordic Bakery were different from American cinnamon buns. They were firm on the outside, soft in the center, less sweet and more spiced. But, like the cinnamon buns I’m used to, they were comforting.

When I think back to London, I miss the jazz music that echoes through the tube station and the East London markets that come to life, especially on warm and sunny days. I miss wandering through my neighborhood without a definite plan. I miss turning the corner and seeing the glass storefront promising cinnamon buns. After being home for a while, I still smile when I notice details at home that remind me of my time in London, especially these cardamom-scented cinnamon buns.

Makes 12 large cinnamon buns

## Ingredients

[img519 fullwidth]

### Dough

2 ⅓ cups lukewarm milk

¾ cup sugar

4 ½ teaspoons, or 2 envelopes active dry yeast

½ teaspoon ground cardamom

12 tablespoons or 1 ½ sticks unsalted butter, melted

1 egg, at room temperature

8 cups all-purpose flour

### Filling

6 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

1 cup packed dark brown sugar

3 tablespoons ground cinnamon

### Glaze

½ cup sugar

1 tablespoon lemon juice

½ cup water

## Materials

Two baking sheets

Parchment paper

Large bowl

Spoon or spatula

Nonstick cooking spray or oil

Rolling pin

Knife

Small saucepan

## Instructions

(1) Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

(2) In a large bowl, mix together the milk, sugar, yeast, cardamom, melted butter and egg. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes until it is foamy. Add the flour, and mix until dough forms. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for about one hour, until doubled in size.

(3) Punch down the dough, and transfer to a lightly floured surface. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out until it is about 12 inches by 30 inches and ¼ inch thick. Spread the softened butter over the dough. Combine the dark brown sugar and cinnamon, and then sprinkle it over the dough.

[img520 fullwidth]

(4) Roll the dough up from a long edge. Cut into 2 ½ inch rolls at an angle – make the first cut diagonal, then do the same in the opposite direction. 
Continue until about 12 buns are cut. Transfer the buns to the parchment-lined pans with the longest edge of the bun sitting on the baking sheet. Cover, and let rise in a warm place for 30-60 minutes until nearly doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 400 F.

(5) Bake the buns for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. Meanwhile, make the glaze. Add the sugar, lemon juice and water to a small saucepan, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10-15 minutes.

(6) Remove the buns from the oven, and drizzle the glaze over the tops. Serve warm with a cup of tea.

103,12,Remembering Him,remembering-him,prime/spring-2016/lead/AYU-1-web.jpg,"My dad died three days after classes started in my first year of college. When I heard the news, I was sure that I wouldn’t be able to do ... well, anything.","[img446]

My dad died three days after classes started in my first year of college. When I heard the news, I was sure that I wouldn’t be able to do ... well, anything. I shut down and just went along with what people told me to do.

A lot of people say that their parents are their inspiration – or their best friends – and for me, my dad was exactly that and so much more. He was practically my whole world. Since I was little, we had spent every possible moment together. He started reading the Wall Street Journal and Sports Illustrated to me until I was old enough to complain that those magazines were too boring. We graduated to “Harry Potter,” until I didn’t allow him to finish the series because I was old enough to read it by myself. More than 10 years after I stole the book out of his hands, he kept whining about the heartbreak he endured every time someone referenced the series.

All throughout my elementary school years, my dad worked in San Francisco, starting his commute from Santa Rosa anywhere between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. in order to work at the large bank headquarters there. Whenever I stayed with him as part of the custody agreement after my parents’ divorce, he would wake up even earlier to drive me over to his sister’s house – that way she could take me to school, where she taught – just so we could spend a few more hours together the evening before.

[img447]

During those years, I often had trouble going to sleep, terrified that my dad would get into a car accident driving into the city. The thought of him dying regularly kept me awake, crying, and even sent me crawling into bed with him a few times. I was scared of being without him – left alone.

But those days passed. When I entered middle school, he quit his job in the city and started working a few miles from our house, where I could walk to his office after school. Most days – all through middle school and high school – I would visit him and remind him to eat something, or just complain about how heavy my backpack was. That proximity to my school also made it possible for him to attend every tennis match of my high school career – and a good number of the practices, too. He proudly told his friends that he got to be the team’s “ball boy.”

I could go through every year, every moment, of my life and point out where I was emulating my dad, where he had taught me something, where he had pushed and pulled me into trying something terrifying but good for me. He knew almost all of my secrets and had the best reactions to everything I told him. Our celebrations, whether they were for birthdays or college acceptance letters, were quiet and often brief, but that was what we were comfortable with – a dinner at our favorite restaurant or rewatching our favorite movie. Usually, either he was gone in the morning to get to work or I was staying with my mom – but more often than not, I woke up to a text that proclaimed just how proud of me he was.

Moving to UCLA was the first time I really had to face something without him being there the whole time, but I clung to his promise that he was only a phone call away. We talked through all of my hopes for college – that I would study abroad, that I would join the newspaper and a few other clubs, that I would try out all of the things I was too scared to do in high school. During those first few days, I texted him almost hourly with updates – ranging from my panic over how scary all my classes were to the new people I was meeting. Every response he sent kept me moving through my homesickness.

[img448]

So when he was gone, I felt hopeless, terrified, distraught, furious and – strangely – apathetic. Some days, even now, it’s hard to get motivated to do anything, even eat. Some days I want to scream at someone, some days all I want is a hug. A lot of the comfort that people try to give falls flat, simply because I can’t imagine that they understand, and there’s nothing that can make the situation better – only having my dad here could do that. But that impossibility also leads into my near-constant roller coaster of emotions: switching daily from irrational anger to sadness to confusion, and hitting every emotion in between. But with time comes practice. Now, eight months later, it’s become easier to manage the influx of emotions and actually feel “normal.”

When I first moved into my dorm, I promised myself that I would stop worrying so much. I told myself that everyone goes to college, and no one’s parents ever die, no matter how much they worry. So when my dad failed to text me first thing in the morning for the first time since I got a cell phone, I did my best not to panic. I went to a coffee shop and started studying, beginning to settle into the idea that I was in college, while simultaneously checking my phone every five minutes for his text. By the time mid-morning passed, I became frantic. I started calling my dad, only to be sent to voicemail. I called his girlfriend, then his best friend – whom I had just been talking to – but neither picked up. I started receiving texts from my mom, asking where I was and telling me to stay there. That was when I really started to panic – she was supposed to be back in Santa Rosa, and she refused to explain why she was in Los Angeles. Ten minutes later, she walked into the coffee shop and pulled me outside. Less than a minute after that, I was convinced that I was having the worst nightmare possible. I couldn’t control what I was doing, I couldn’t feel my own body and I needed to talk to my dad. The day itself is blurry – all I remember is overwhelming confusion. I couldn’t understand how this had happened, or what I had done wrong. I even briefly convinced myself that I had killed him by leaving for UCLA and subsequently breaking his heart.

During my week in Santa Rosa – after flying back home to my family on the night I found out the news – I realized that I needed to go back to school. Picking out the urn for his ashes, listening to the condolences of my closest friends, visiting all the places that we had frequented – it was too much.

Returning to UCLA was difficult. I didn’t really know anyone, it was a new town and I had missed the first full week of classes. But I wanted the challenge of school, hoping that it would distract me from my grief and confusion. And that plan worked, for the most part. That first quarter, I had to block off a few hours a day just in case my grief got to be too much, which made making friends hard – harder than just missing that first week of classes. But I managed to make a few friends who made the bad days better, and who could make me laugh and not look at me with pity.

Therapy helped, too, even without the deep, movie-esque plunge through every aspect of every emotion I have. Knowing that someone is there for you, that their actual job is to listen to you rant or cry or just talk is inordinately comforting. Being able to spew out that I feel guilty and angry and I kind of want a hug – and not be stared at like I’ve lost my mind – is a relief. Even better, the therapist was able to at least assure me that I am normal. My therapist would walk me through what I was feeling and remind me (when I was at my most irrational) that my dad’s death was not my fault. He died of a heart attack, not of a broken heart, and anyway, I didn’t break his heart by going to college – I made him proud.

[img449]

Besides just letting me talk, my therapist also gave me strategies to deal with the issues that surfaced following my dad’s death. Sometimes I would disassociate from what was happening – I would struggle to focus or register what was happening as reality – so she recommended that I use mindfulness exercises to help ground myself. When I would suffer panic attacks, she would tell me to talk to someone about anything – to have them reassure me that I was going to be OK, or even just tell me about their day to get my mind off of my panic. She helped me develop plans to deal with or get out of uncomfortable situations or conversations.

Having that support is reassuring – especially a few months after the event, and in a place as big as UCLA. It’s easier to keep up a facade that everything is always fine, even when that’s not true. That facade seems to make it easier for people to forget that I’m still grieving. But grieving doesn’t stop after a couple months. It keeps hurting, but more often than not, it’s just a hum in the back of your mind. Sometimes the pain is all you can think about, but those times are not necessarily a daily, or even weekly, occurrence – which is manageable.

Now, it’s easier for me to go out and do what my dad and I had planned – I want to make him proud, and it’s a way for me to keep him in mind as much as possible without feeling like I can’t breathe. But even as I’m doing all that, there are still times when I worry that I’ll forget him. I worry that I forget how he used to put hot sauce on everything and then whine about the spiciness. Or how excited he got over freshly made doughnuts or a box set of an old TV show. I sometimes worry that I’ll grow into a person that he wouldn’t know anymore – or even worse, that he wouldn’t like.

But if there is anything that my dad taught me, it is that we have to come from a place of love, not fear. I love my dad more than anything, and he taught me to keep moving forward when things are difficult. So out of love for him, that’s what I’ll do.",44,""

Venice, Calif., has a reputation that transcends continents.

The only other “famous” Venice besides the original one in Italy, the two places share little resemblance other than a series of canals and the ability to attract celebrities.

But there is much more to Venice than merely the skater-filled boardwalk or the body builders that line Muscle Beach.

The only Westside haven for the weird, Venice stands out on this side of town as the funky, younger cousin of preppy Brentwood and Santa Monica.

Venice is an amalgam of several cities. The chic homes that dot the canals seem a world away from the trendy boutiques of Abbot Kinney Boulevard, and both stand in sharp contrast to the city’s boardwalk, with its vibrant street artists, henna tattoos and dozens of pipe shops. Venice is high-end, grungy – elite, but also very warm.

In effect, Venice is representative of Los Angeles as a whole – a mishmash of people, economic classes, desires and opportunities. In Venice, the Range Rover moms eat at the same mom-and-pop pizza joints as the surfer dudes.

As always, prime is here to offer you the best that this neighborhood enclave has to offer. Take a Sunday and explore – you won't be sorry.

-----

[img258 centered]

### **THE BOARDWALK**

No trip to Venice would be complete without visiting the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Take a stroll along the beach and watch rollerbladers, skaters and body builders enjoy the sun and the surf.

The Boardwalk itself is littered with small stands selling everything from postcards to dream catchers to paintings, though there are a few true stores.

One such brick-and-mortar highlight is Small World Books. Nestled next to The Sidewalk Café, near the back, Small World Books is a sight for sore eyes. As the number of independent bookstores continues to dwindle in Los Angeles, Small World Books is a relic of a time gone by. Quaint and jam-packed with everything from bestsellers to artsy 'zines, Small World is as charming as it is well-priced.

[img262 left]

Even better, the bookstore houses a librarian cat – Conan – who can be spotted lounging in various parts of the store. With its coziness and charm, Small World Books is a welcome respite from the people-packed and intense boardwalk.

Just off the Boardwalk, at the corner of Windward Avenue and Pacific Avenue, there are a number of other charming shops and restaurants.

Check out local favorite Mao’s Kitchen for standout Chinese “country-style” food. Not to mention, their menu is amusing, offering options like “Peace not war wonton” soup ($8) and “Model citizen noodle soup” ($9). Café Collage next door is a good place to stop for a specialty latte or pastry, and they’re reasonably priced too.

Word to the wise: On the actual boardwalk, watch out for scamming street performers as well as people inviting you into medicinal marijuana doctor recommendation shops – they’re perfectly safe, but aggressive.

[img255 centered]

### **ABBOT KINNEY**

Abbot Kinney Boulevard is the heart of trendy Venice, a collection of just-eclectic-enough boutiques and restaurants that the Westside rich can feel grungy without having to actually drive over to Silver Lake.

That being said, Abbot Kinney is still a delight. While the street does play host to a number of bars and restaurants, the two standout places to grab a bite aren’t restaurants at all.

Intelligentsia Coffee, with locations across the city, has long been considered the best coffee in town, and that fact remains true at the Venice location. However, it’s the store’s chic industrial ambience that makes it a catch, plus the wealth of seating. Order a cappuccino and a pastry, and sit down to write your screenplay like everyone else is pretending to.

[img256 right]

Across the street and down the block is N’iceCream, a charming storefront selling freshly made gelato and sorbet. While the flavors change on a daily basis, standouts include the stracciatella and hazelnut (made with real Nutella). Stop by for a cone or a cup on a hot day and take a rest on the charming rustic benches inside.

While most of the boutiques are hideously overpriced, they can be fun for window-shopping.

Bountiful is one such shop. While the inside is lined floor to ceiling (literally) with antique glassware and china that is priced out of any college student’s range, the sidewalk sale bins are a treasure trove. You’ll find colorful mason jars and other home goods on the cheap, stacked next to buckets of seashells, sold by the scoop.

Abbot Kinney also plays host to a number of high-end art galleries that are scattered along the busy street. Take a look inside C.A.V.E. Gallery if you have a minute to glance at some truly forward-thinking art, or just take a breather and sip your coffee in peace while enjoying something new.

[img261 centered]

### **OFF THE BEATEN PATH**

There is much more to Venice than just Abbot Kinney or the Boardwalk.

Start with Superba Snack Bar. The Italian-esque eatery is open and adorable, with edgy tile work and communal tables. While the food is top-notch regardless of what time of day you stop by, the brunch menu will afford the most bang for your buck.

[img254 left]

We recommend the veggies and eggs (sunny-side up eggs, kale pesto, fingerling potatoes, broccolini, pecorino and caramelized onions, $16) or the potato and rosemary waffle (ham, poached egg and mornay, $14). If you’re looking for something particularly great, try the crispy French toast ($15). Made of brioche with a side of berries and chantilly cream, the French toast is sweet and crunchy, but it’s the unique texture of the side of buttered syrup that will take you by surprise.

Another important stop is the Venice Canals. These narrow waterways, reminiscent of the original ones in Italy, are an inlet from the Pacific. They’re quite shallow and are dotted with homes, most of which have a little boat and dock in the yard for a watery jaunt. Take a walk along the banks or cross over one of the many bridges for a charming view. The Dell Avenue bridges are a good place to start.

-----

Parking tips: Bring cash if you’re planning to park anywhere near the Boardwalk, as street parking is exceptionally limited and most lots only take cash. Parking on Abbot Kinney is varied – there is some street parking on the actual boulevard, but there are also public lots behind the stores where you can try your luck. For the canals, park on any of the nearby side streets.

Yarnell Street seems like any other suburban neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley.

The east side of the Sylmar, California, road features two one-story homes – a blue-trimmed white house with a minivan out front and an orange house with a hedge and American flag.

But on the west side of the street, behind a clay-colored fence, wild animals thrive in their oasis.

The fence leads down a dirt driveway lined with silver olive trees, whose black fruits lie smashed at our feet, pits oozing out of the skin. At the end of the drive, a plastic iguana sits on an old tree trunk, foreshadowing the critters to come.

From Zeus the blind western screech-owl to Lola the two-toed sloth, animals at the Wildlife Learning Center provide the public with interactive education about wildlife. The wild-born animals are too injured or dependent on people to be rereleased, and the domestic creatures could not survive in the wilderness.

Wildlife Learning Center co-founders Paul Hahn and UCLA alumnus David Riherd have been rescuing the animals to teach people about biology for more than 20 years.

## A natural connection

[img490 fullwidth]

Hahn and Riherd grew up in different states, but both near pond ecosystems with animals such as fish, snakes and salamanders. As young children, they each spent their free time exploring ponds and forests, they told me, sitting at a picnic table in the Wildlife Learning Center. Two scarlet macaws were perched in the distance, dappled in sunlight.

Growing up in the Midwest, Hahn ventured into the woods and lakes with his outdoorsy family during frequent camping and fishing trips. He created his own animal classes in second grade, inviting the neighborhood kids to the woods and showing them schematic diagrams to teach about morphology, the structures of different species.

Flies buzzed around us and kids babbled in the background as Riherd described his childhood in Altadena, California, at the base of the San Gabriel mountains.

He lived near a canyon with close proximity to hiking trails. Every summer, his parents took him to the Sierra Nevada mountains. His exposure to nature led to his interest in animals, he said. As a child, he caught snakes, volunteered at a local nature center and collected diverse pets – dogs, snakes, turtles, lizards, geese, ducks, goats, chickens, rabbits and pheasants.

“I wasn’t one of those kids that got an animal and expected my parents to take care of it,” Riherd said.

Though he grew up reading animal books for fun, Riherd went on to study sociology at UCLA. To this day he doesn’t know why he didn’t major in biology.
“I think I was just kind of a late bloomer and didn’t really realize what I wanted to do,” Riherd said. “But yeah I know, it made perfect sense to be a biology major.”

Riherd decided to study molecular biology in graduate school at Cal State Northridge. He met Hahn in a chemistry class.

“One of us mentioned something about ponds and the other was like, ‘Oh my god, you like ponds? I like ponds too!’ and everyone was thinking, ‘OK these guys are geeking out,’” Hahn said. “That’s when we immediately hit it off that we were both animal nuts.”

The students had a few small pets, like snakes and frogs. They kept the creatures at Riherd’s apartment or in Hahn’s duplex’s garage, which he converted into a place to store tanks for the animals.

The teaching began when Riherd’s friend, a teacher, asked if he could bring the animals to her class and talk about biology. She enjoyed the lesson, Riherd said, and introduced him to the school enrichment coordinator for the district. The biologists then began traveling to about 12 elementary schools in Palos Verdes, California, where each school had a set day of the week to be visited for a three- to four-week period.

""One of our selling points was, ‘Hey, you’re learning about this from biologists,' whereas in the classroom you may have a teacher that doesn’t have a science background at all,” Riherd said.

The more they taught, the more pets they acquired from parents who, for example, no longer wanted their pet turtle. The business was outreach, operating out of a van. Hahn and Riherd began hiring other biologists to help teach, including UCLA alumni like veterinarian Susie Garity.

More than a decade ago, while in graduate school, Hahn and Riherd signed a contract with the Los Angeles Unified School District to visit about five Title I schools a day, five days a week, for four to six weeks. The funding was available for Title I schools, which are failing to meet academic standards and whose students come from low-income families, Riherd said.

“Unlike many of us who are privileged to grow up in areas or have parents that could facilitate natural experience, a lot of these urban kids have never been out of the middle of the city, never been to the zoo, never been to the beach,” Hahn said.

Teaching is special for Hahn because his lesson could be a child’s first interaction with nature and inspire him or her to pursue the field.
“If they’re a biologist deep down inside, and they’ve never been exposed to the amazingness of nature, all they would see is, 'Oh that’s a difficult subject,’” he said.

In October 2007, the organization moved into a permanent residence in Sylmar while it was still nothing but an old olive grove. They wanted to be close to Los Angeles since they were teaching for LAUSD. The property was previously used for heavy agriculture, so the zoning permitted keeping animals on the lot.

“I was there when everything was just dirt,” said then-co-manager Garity.

Hahn and Riherd built everything on the single-acre property. Riherd planted each of the approximately 1,000 plants. Hahn carved the wooden signs that label different enclosures. Both biologists dug out trenches to lay the plumbing and electricity.

They held their opening party in April 2008, about six months later. But that same year, they lost their contract with LAUSD because of the economic recession. With their biggest source of funding gone, they quickly decided to open their center to the public and create the on-site education program it is today. By investing their own money and receiving help from family, they survived the recession despite bumpy years spending money on their bills, the lease and the enclosures.

Money remains the most difficult part of the business, Hahn said, since it costs $2,000 a day to run the Wildlife Learning Center.
However, they get some financial help from high-profile donors, including actress Betty White, who discovered the center while filming and has since donated a veterinary suite. When the actress visits, she’ll sit on the picnic tables and the owners bring her animals.

“What kind of animals does she like?”

“All of them. She’ll hold them in and pull them into her chest and her neck, and she closes her eyes and just swaddles it and kisses on it. We’re all just kind of like, ‘Betty, do you want another animal yet?’” Hahn said.

She even kisses the monitor lizard.

Actress Julia Roberts and her family also ventured in for a visit, sitting in the office playing with baby monkeys for two hours.
Riherd stopped to look up at a squirrel. Hahn said the indigenous animals add to the atmosphere.

""You kind of feel like you’re in the woods or at least not in LA,” he said. “If you saw, this is kind of surrounded by neighborhoods and industrial area, so it’s kind of a little oasis.”

Right on cue, a train tooted its low horn, drowning out the sparrows’ chirping for a moment before the serenity was restored.
 
## Saving each other

[img493 fullwidth]

It was just like she had never left.

When Susie Garity came home from veterinary school every eight months, her first stop was the Wildlife Learning Center. The owners gave her the keys and she went straight into the serval enclosure, picked up Kodi and held the lynx like a baby.

Garity graduated from UCLA in 2005 with a degree in ecology, behavior and evolution. She knew she wanted to work with animals, so she applied to the Wildlife Learning Center after seeing a job listing online. By the time Garity left for veterinary school in 2009, she was a co-manager who had fallen in love with the cats at the nonprofit organization.

Garity grew up in a broken home in the Inland Empire, she said. She had a rough life, and her cats were her only real friends, namely her orange childhood felines September and December.

""I would say I’ve always preferred animals to humans,"" Garity said. “When you grew up and you don’t really know what love is, it’s hard for you to trust people.”

She thus had an inclination to work with cats at the Wildlife Learning Center when she started as a wildlife biologist and educator. Her job included 
primarily animal care – husbandry and training – and conducting education and outreach programs at schools and parties.

A few months after Garity started working, the center acquired Tag the serval, a spotted African cat. He was distrusting and required a lot of patience.

""He wasn’t the friendliest of critters, and I kind of decided I was really going to get to know him and work with him,” Garity said.

The goal was to have him be an educator and ambassador animal, so she had to train him to walk on a leash. Though he eventually cooperated, his initial response was to roll on the ground, claw, bite or try to play – and wild animals’ play can quickly turn into aggression, she said.

Garity’s other favorite cat is the lynx Kodi, who she raised since he was 6 weeks old.

Kodi was shy at first, but she stepped up as surrogate mom. She took him home with her at night for several months because he needed nursing care, and there was no one at the center over night. It was an opportunity to bond, and since Kodi wasn’t weaned yet, she worked on hand-feeding him and teaching him not be aggressive toward food.

Over a process of several weeks, she worked up to putting a collar on him, first placing the collar near him, clicking it near him, laying it on his neck and finally putting it on.

Garity spent extra time hanging out with the cats, sitting outside their exhibits so they would get used to her and accept her. They reminded her a little of herself, because she understood their distrust in people.


“I’m more reserved, too,” she said. “I got them.”

Both Tag and Kodi were certainly challenging, she laughed through tears.

""If I didn’t end up at the Wildlife Learning Center and specifically didn’t meet Tag, I probably wouldn’t really know what love is,” she said. “I definitely love those cats. We saved each other.”

##Stepping into the island jungle

[img492 fullwidth]

We toured the Wildlife Learning Center on a sunny October day, beginning by the picnic tables under an overhang decorated with twinkle lights.
Small children ran by screaming, “Cheetahs!” after seeing the serval exhibit.

The nearest enclosure housed Nanuck the Arctic fox, who sometimes chases her red fox co-inhabitant. Before she was rescued, she was destined to become a fur coat. The lemurs, which sometimes sit in the sun and meditate, came from an Indiana zoo.

Porcupines munched on carrots and chunks of watermelon rinds in their tin-roofed enclosure. Two blond boys leaned on the rope outside, waving to a baby porcupine waddling behind the chain link fence.

Hahn and Riherd led us inside the exhibit, which guests can enter during onsite interactive tours.

We noticed a porcupine climbing up the fence baring its orange teeth.

“That’s rust,” Riherd said.

Hahn handed us leafy ficus branches to feed to the quilled creatures. They stood up on their hind legs and curiously leaned toward our outstretched arms. More chubby porcupines wobbled to us like Winnie the Pooh. Hahn reached down to pet one in a front-to-back motion to avoid an unfortunate encounter with the quills on its lower back. Riherd said petting their straw-like fur makes him too itchy.

The baby porcupine, which was born at the Wildlife Learning Center, stepped on my feet and gently lifted his weight onto my leg and began climbing me like a tree. His claws – luckily relatively dull – firmly pressed into my shin before Hahn picked him up by his two front paws and pulled him away.

“Aren’t they charismatic and awesome?” Hahn said.

The founders started listing the names of the spiny animals – Walter, Betty, Alan, Freddy, Gerdy and Gus Gus.
“Like Cinderella?” I said.

“Yeah, that’s where it came from,” Riherd said.

[img491 fullwidth]

We moved further through the center past the big-eared fennec foxes toward the bald eagles, which were injured in the wild. As for the alligator named Fluffy, he lived in a bathtub before and now basks in the Sylmar sun.

“He doesn’t look like it, but he’s fast,” Hahn said, looking at the reptile’s dark unfocused eyes. “He’s looking at us.”

They explained that alligators whip their powerful tails to protect themselves and their babies.

“Which is rare in reptiles,” Riherd added.

We moved closer to the front of the property toward the prairie dog habitat. The furry animals bobbed up and down, jumping against the glass and 
making a screeching sound while trying to burrow.

“I want one!” my friend said.

“No you don’t,” they said at the same time. “They’re biters.”

The tortoises are friendlier and don’t bite – as long as you don’t visit them with your toenails painted red, resembling strawberries.
Back at the red picnic tables, we passed by the perched red macaws. They are strongly bonded and fell in love, Hahn said. He likens them to an old married couple.

Our last stop on the tour was the reptile house. A Brazilian rainbow boa was cozied up in its glass tank. Nearby lives a Burmese python that’s frequently compared to the one in Britney Spears’ 2001 MTV Video Music Awards performance.

They also have a giant bullfrog the size of a football.

“Do you know what we feed it?” Riherd said. “Mice.”

The founders took us into the back feeding room, filled with shelves of dishes and white boards with feeding scheduled laid out; “a.m.” schedules were written in blue marker and “p.m.” in green. The boards listed the different animals – Boomer, Sage, Newton, Zeus – with the appropriate grams of food next to them.

White bins full of biscuits lined the wooden floor adjacent to freezers full of mice and rats for the carnivores.

One shelf stored buckets of live mealworms and chirping crickets. A shelf above contained enrichment spices like Trader Joe’s cinnamon that get sprinkled into the habitats; the new scents simulate a real, investigable environment. The top shelf held empty toilet paper rolls and a Coca-Cola cardboard box, in which the biologists hide food to provide more challenges for their animals like they would encounter in the wild.

We left the reptile house and met two final animals.

“You’ll like meeting Boomer,” Riherd said.

“Would you mind bringing me the Gila and a pair of gloves?” Hahn asked an employee.

“Come on buddy, “ Riherd said, coaxing Boomer the lynx out of his enclosure. “Wanna come out?”

The black-tailed cat was bred for the pet trade in Oregon but went unsold.

Hahn brought out their Gila monster, a lizard that was an illegal pet before it found a new home at the center.

“Can you see his tongue?” a mom asked her kids, who were examining the Gila.

Hahn and Riherd never imagined when they started bringing their van of animals to classrooms that now they’d be running a nonprofit organization with about 100 visitors a day. They’ve delivered about 24,000 presentations so far, Hahn said.

The most important part of the Wildlife Learning Center is the education component, Garity said. She hopes the animals can impact children and get the respect the critters need.

""It’s important for people to be able to get up close and personal and be able to really understand where these animals come from,” Garity said. “Animals are life-changing if you kind of let them in. ... They give you something, and they touch your soul in a way that changes you.”

On April 7, a sold-out crowd gathered at Royce Hall to watch the production of the 25th annual Korean Culture Night, entitled “When You Kill a Butterfly.” More than 130 students behind the production were tasked with a yearlong process of writing scripts, casting, making props, choreographing and rehearsing, which culminated in a three-hour show telling the story of “comfort women” – Korean women who were sexually enslaved by the Japanese army during World War II.

Each year, KCN aims to share an aspect of Korean culture with the UCLA community. Similar to other cultural showcases on campus, KCN brings together members of the Korean community while also inspiring students from other cultures to participate.

***

In previous years, KCN has told universal stories on topics such as familyhood and generational differences. The topic of comfort women proved to be one that was much more emotionally and politically charged.

[img451 fullwidth]

In December, the Japanese government agreed to an $8.3 million settlement to surviving comfort women. The controversial issue of comfort women has put additional political strain not only on those involved, but also on the two cultures as a whole. As a result, this year’s show was challenging to produce – many people did not want to engage in the polarization that came with supporting the show.

“Even during cast auditions, people didn’t show up for the second round because people started catching on that it was about comfort women,” said Eddie Kang, assistant producer of KCN and a third-year mathematics student.

With auditions that usually draw 70 to 80 applicants each year, KCN found that many students who were at first interested in performing for the show backed out. Even members of the executive staff faced concerns from family and friends regarding their participation in the show.

“When I told my parents that I was writing a show about comfort women, my mom was super against it,” said Eric Lim, executive producer of KCN and a fourth-year economics student. “(Activists) get death threats back home, and there have been instances where they are not allowed to enter Japan, so it’s like, ‘Why do I do this when I could just make a show about a rom-com?’”

[img452 fullwidth]

KCN is a completely crowd-sponsored production and the topic drove away sponsors who had consistently donated in years past.

“If we do something like this, some sponsors don’t like to get involved,” Lim said. “We have to think not only about the artistic end, which is directly outputted onto the stage, but we also have to think about everything that is required to form this show.”

***

Lim, a three-year veteran of KCN, said he believed that presenting a production that moved away from the lighthearted mood of previous showcases was culturally important.

“When we are here talking about heritage and history as Korean people, you have to take the good and the bad,” Lim said. “Too often do we focus on the lighter and good part, but in reality, the opposite makes up just as much or even more.”

For Joshua Kang, director of KCN and a fourth-year political science and economics student, the cultural significance and need to educate the UCLA community about the story of comfort women outweighed many other factors.

“This is a big, big part of our culture that has been hidden under the rug,” Kang said. “It’s like a scar that you have on your body – you don’t want to show to people, so you cover it up, right? And that’s what this was.”

With only about 40 surviving comfort women left, timeliness also dictated the executive staff’s final decision. The drive to tell the story of comfort women was fueled by the staff’s increasing desire to keep the issue from fading away.

Even weeks after the show, “When You Kill a Butterfly” faced continuous discussion and criticism over social media. Though at first taken aback and offended, KCN’s executive staff members soon realized another take on the brewing conversation.

[img455 fullwidth]

“That’s when we knew we had made an impact. They were talking about ... the issue of comfort women,” Lim said. “We realized that people were curious about the theme, and that was our goal from the beginning of the year: to educate.”

36,6,Writing on the Wall,writing-wall,prime/fall-2014/lead/prime.webgraphic.murals_EDITED.jpg,Inside the fight to re-legalize and save Los Angeles’ public art in the nation’s mural capital.,"[img305 fullwidth]

For more than a decade, all new murals painted on private property in the city of Los Angeles were illegal.

And then a year ago – with a simple vote from City Hall – they weren’t.

From 2002 until 2013, a signage moratorium that governed public advertisements left most murals in Los Angeles in a legal limbo.

The moratorium was enacted in response to the proliferation of large works on private property, which aimed to sell commercial products.

In 2003, Los Angeles moved to ban these advertisements, which were passing under the guise of art, but complaints by sign companies led the city to simply ban all signage on city walls, which included murals.

The controversy came down to a single paragraph in the city code that classified murals as equivalent to advertisements and billboards, banning them all, full stop.

[img236 centered]

Artists across the city mainly ignored the moratorium, preferring to keep the politics out of their painting. It was only after completed, older murals came under attack from whitewashers that muralists began to band together to fight the law.

“It was the first time I really saw the Los Angeles muralists and public art community come together like that,” said artist Kristy Sandoval.

In order to get around the limiting regulation, artists often used loopholes in the language of the moratorium, doing things like painting on schools, which often had protected status as city property.

In 2011, as a result of the whitewashing outcry, the Los Angeles City Council commissioned a Mural Working Group that consisted of artists, gallery owners and the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles to help develop a new ordinance to govern murals in the city.

[img233 right]

Dozens of meetings between stakeholders were held to determine exactly how to split the city’s definition between an original art mural and a public advertisement.

Even with overwhelming support from the public art community and city councilmembers, the creation of the committee was only the beginning of a months-long process to push the ordinance through city bureaucracy.

On Aug. 28, 2013, with a vote of 13-2, a new ordinance governing the state of murals in the City of Los Angeles was approved.

At the forefront of the charge for the mural ordinance was Isabel Rojas-Williams, executive director of the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles. For her, the right to public art is particularly personal. She left her home in Chile during the 1970s to escape persecution, and possible execution, for painting political slogans on public walls.

------

The current mural ordinance contains two distinctions that classify the type of murals depending on when they were painted.

Murals painted before the advent of the 2013 mural ordinance were grandfathered in and given official status. Iconic pieces, such as the Victor Clothing Company's murals in the historic area of downtown or ""Cream of the Crop"" in the Arts District, are now supposed to be legally sanctioned.

Murals painted after the passage of the ordinance would be eligible for a permit that would give the artwork protected status for at least two years.

While these newly installed pieces are subject to a variety of rules and restrictions, some artists are arguing that the updated system limits their freedom of expression.

[img243 left]

An email from Felicia Filer, the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs Public Art Division director, said the response to the permitting system has been varied, but some artists have found it easy.

Yet Sandoval, who painted the first mural to receive official permitting under the new rules by the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs, disagrees.

She said she thinks her piece, “Keep Pacoima Beautiful,” which is situated on the corner of Glenoaks and Van Nuys boulevards in Pacoima, was a mess of bureaucratic entanglements.

Currently, in order to obtain an official mural permit from the city, applicants must complete the following process.

First, an artist with a mural idea contacts the Department of Cultural Affairs to get the mural registration materials.

After receiving the materials, the permit applicant is required to set up a community meeting to communicate to the larger community the significance of the mural.

Once the community meeting has been held and approval by the building owner and the local neighborhood council is received, the permit applicant sends in the registration materials along with a $60 fee.

If the department approves the mural, the artist is then given the go-ahead to paint or install the artwork, after which they submit more documents for a final review by the Department of Cultural Affairs.

[img235 right]

Simply listing all the steps, however, doesn’t really reveal the time and financial cost of the process, Sandoval said.

For example, the $60 permitting fee doesn’t reveal the $40 filing fee with the city and the cost of installing the required anti-graffiti coating.

Sandoval said she paid out of pocket for all costs associated with “Keep Pacoima Beautiful,” including hundreds of dollars to install anti-graffiti coating on the work.

She added that applying for a permit also takes a large amount of time – she said she thinks multiple visits to government agencies can be a bureaucratic nightmare, and logistical elements, like finding a building’s ultimate property owner, can be challenging and stressful.

[img240 centered]
[img296 right]

However, Sandoval said that despite the permitting headache, she still sees the importance of guaranteeing her mural’s protection.

“It’s more for everyone else, not for my ego,” she said. “It’s important to register the murals because I want to make sure that it has a lasting impact on the community.”

Still, Sandoval admits that the hassle of applying for a permit has probably dissuaded some artists from trying to protect their work.

In the year since the passage of the new mural ordinance, fewer than 50 mural applications have been received. Of that number, only a handful have been officially registered, according to numbers obtained from the Department of Cultural Affairs.

[img295 left]

Besides the long process for getting the mural registered, another criticism of the ordinance is that it hampers the creative freedom of the artist.

Sandoval said because the process involves getting the design approved in advance by city officials, it stops her from making any last-minute changes while painting the work.

“It restricts me from having a moment of inspiration,” Sandoval said. “When I’m painting, I don't want to have to have that inspiration stopped.”

In the year since the passage of the original ordinance, the city has also made some changes to the law that pertain to protecting installed murals and opening up the number of walls available for artists.

[img237 left]

An amendment to the mural ordinance brought forward in May aimed to address the fact that many property owners are unfamiliar with the bureaucratic process.

Previous to the May amendment, some property owners were hit with notices of noncompliance, even if the murals on their property were going through the application process. As a result, the fear of the thousands of dollars in fines that could be levied led to the whitewashing of ostensibly protected works by the property owners.

The amendment attempted to fix this unnecessary action by giving property owners the proper information regarding the notices and how to move forward legally.

The ordinance has also provided an option for some councilmembers to opt into allowing murals on single-family homes in their district.

------

Critics’ main arguments for overturning the mural moratorium were twofold. One, a new ordinance was needed to protect the city’s artistic history, and two, any observer would be able to tell the difference between a sign and a mural.

With a history going back more than half a century, murals in Los Angeles are well-integrated into the city’s cultural landscape. Recent events, however, have shown the distinction between artwork and advertising may be less obvious than originally anticipated.

[img231 centered]

With a good dose of human drama, the most publicized of these conflicts involves a controversial public art figure, an indie rock band and the mayor of Los Angeles.

The battleground for the summer’s biggest conflict over public art now lays bare. A plain white wall overlooks a nondescript lot in downtown that housed hundreds of screaming, selfie-taking fans just a few months ago.

A massive mural for the band Foster the People on the side of the Santa Fe Lofts was painted in January in advance of the release of the band’s album, “Supernatural.”

The mural featured artwork from the album’s cover and measured 125 feet high. The process for painting the mural had been used in a music video for the album track, “Coming of Age.”

Foster the People announced that the city was going to paint over the mural in July, citing improper permitting and the definition in the mural ordinance that prohibits advertisements as part of the mural.

The band appealed to its fans for help, and a social media campaign to save the mural began. Dozens of comments flooded L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Instagram account, and an online petition garnered more than 12,000 signatures.

“Don’t call it a mural – it’s a sign,” said Rojas-Williams. “The vast majority of these people were fans of the band. They had no idea between the difference of the sign and a legitimate work of art.”

[img285 right]

Spurred on by the attention, Garcetti came in and contacted the building owner and mediated a temporary stay for the mural. During this cooling-off period, the band hosted a celebration at the site of the mural, giving out free posters and merchandise to fans.

The reprieve was short-lived.

In August, Garcetti released a joint statement with the band and the building owner informing the public that the work was to be painted over.

Mere weeks after the announcement that the mural was saved, the entire side of the building was whitewashed.

[img239 left]

Daniel Lahoda, founder of the L.A. Freewalls Project, an organization which aims to connect muralists with willing property owners, organized and helped to paint the mural, which was one of the largest in California.

The city said the mural violated the structure’s status as a historic building, but Lahoda contends that it was simply a way to limit artists’ freedom of expression.

“It was really kind of backhanded, the way the city did it,” Lahoda said. “They wanted to create this narrative that we were putting this big billboard up to try and bamboozle the community.”

East Los Angeles-based artist Sonia Romero, who often works with governments and corporations to install murals, said it's up to artists to uphold their own ethical principles.

“I think it's okay to have the sponsorship of a large company, but it's up to an artist to negotiate to have the freedom of expression,” Romero said.

While Lahoda remains a divisive figure in the L.A. public and street art community, he had some choice words for the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles and the way the mural ordinance was being administered.

[img242 right]

He labeled the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles and artists like Romero and Sandoval as compliant to the bureaucratic system, which he views as opposing the counter-cultural mission of murals themselves.

“When it comes to getting art on the wall, there’s a certain amount of preferential treatment, depending on how compliant the artist may or may not be,” Lahoda said.

Lahoda, who in his capacity as a founder of the L.A. Freewalls Project was part of the Mural Working Group, said his organization pioneered many of the steps now used for official permitting, including holding community meetings.

Although he said the mural ordinance was important in overturning the moratorium, Lahoda said he thinks the way the ordinance is being administered – which drives up cost and time commitments for artists – is actually deterring muralists from protecting their own art.

“Until the law reflects the spirit of the community and the spirit of the ordinance and the spirit of the art as a tool for social change, we’ll continue to butt heads,” Lahoda said. “We’re not anti-ordinance, we’re anti-fascism.”

------

Ironically, some of the first murals came to Los Angeles in partnership with the government – the Works Project Administration, a New Deal project, paid for murals to go up in and around government property as a way of offering jobs to artists in the opportunity-starved Great Depression.

In the year since the passage of the mural ordinance and the overturning of the moratorium, public spectacle and political grandstanding has often overshadowed the original intention of the art.

But even while conflict rages over the role of regulation in public art, a singular sentiment can be heard over the din of debate – the belief that murals act as catalysts for social change.

“A mural is a mirror,” Rojas-Williams said. “Murals are abrasive precisely because they speak to all the issues that affect us in society. They add a voice to the voiceless on the walls of Los Angeles.”",5,""

32,6,Meet Me on the Metro,meet-me-metro,prime/fall-2014/lead/prime.webgraphic.metro_EDITED.jpg,Ryan Nelson teaches his tips and tricks for making the most out of LA’s Metro rail.,"[img307 fullwidth]

There are two things that have come to define Los Angeles’ trajectory as a city: water and transportation.

More so than the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, the idyllic beaches or the perpetually sun-kissed weather, it’s these two factors that have contributed the most in molding Los Angeles into the metropolis it is today.

Los Angeles’ deep – and sometimes parasitic – relationship with water is known history at this point. The story of a self-taught engineer and famous street name recipient William Mulholland blazing his way across the vast California desert to siphon off water from Owens Valley has already cemented itself in Angeleno lore.

But there’s another history at play here, and it’s one that doesn’t get as much airtime. Once upon a time, car-mad Los Angeles was very much a train town, with a bustling Union Station and more than 1,000 miles of above-ground streetcars.

[img244 fullwidth]

After World War II, an inverse relationship between what Americans wanted and what streetcars provided became evident: The system buckled under the weighty (but eventually costly) convenience of the automobile, and in 1963 was dismantled fully.

Los Angeles would go 27 years without anything but buses, until the Blue Line, which ran along some of the former trolley car routes and connected downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach, opened in 1990.

Metro, Los Angeles’ public transit agency, was founded that same year and has since had to deal with a myriad of complaints.

But as a city obsessed with movies should know, reality and representation don’t always match.

To find out once and for all what Metro was all about, I gave myself a distinct challenge over the summer: three months, using only one tank of gas. I bought a $50 unlimited Metro card, and spent my next 90 days riding buses and rails to and from work, school and play.

What follows is a breakdown of my experience on the Metro – the best lines, stops and places – all of which are just a quick train ride away.

[img290 fullwidth]

The Red Line was Los Angeles’ first – and up until this year – last attempt at building a comprehensive subway system. The line is the sole train line connecting the Los Angeles Basin with its suburban counterpart in the San Fernando Valley, and thus remains one of Metro’s busiest lines.

The nearest station to UCLA is the Hollywood/Highland station, which is accessible by taking the 2/302 bus down Sunset Boulevard directly to Highland Avenue and walking two blocks north. It’s an area rich with Hollywood history, including the TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman’s Chinese Theatre) and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Hop on the line and head south, toward Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. Along the way, get off at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, where you’ll find a quick two-block walk to Amoeba Music, one of Los Angeles' most famous record stores. Inside, you’ll find a near-impenetrable labyrinth of collectable vinyl, CDs and merchandise that range from oldies to indies.

Past this, the Westlake/MacArthur Park station offers a glimpse of one Los Angeles' prettiest parks, and it usually has a flea market running parallel to it.

At the Pershing Square station, it’s a short walk to the Walt Disney Concert Hall, City Hall and the Grand Central Market. City Hall hosts movie nights throughout the year, and Grand Central Market is every eccentric food lover’s dream, with stalls catering to tastes from oysters to currywurst.

The end of line is Union Station.

The famous transportation hub was built in the 1930s and features historically Spanish architecture. Efforts are currently underway to renovate the station and ensure it remains as important to the city’s future as it was to its past.

But if Union Station is representative of everything Los Angeles has become, Olvera Street – which is directly adjacent – is symbolic of everything it was.

Olvera Street pays homage to the city’s Mexican past, and is the oldest part of downtown Los Angeles. It’s a quiet oasis at an intersection of culture, tranquility and heritage, all contrasted against the backdrop of the towers of finance and industry that dot the skyline of the former pueblo.

[img289 fullwidth]

The Purple Line, more so than any other project Metro is working on, has had a tough time turning its potential energy into kinetic.

The Westside Subway Extension project, as it’s called, runs nearly parallel, though further south to the Red Line, except for a small two-stub segment that runs underneath Wilshire Boulevard to Western Avenue.

Metro has plans to extend the Purple Line all the way to UCLA, but most of that work won’t be completed for another 20 years. In the meantime, check out Koreatown. The Wilshire/Western station resides right in its heart, and there’s a multitude of good Korean barbecue restaurants nearby, such as Castle 2 Korean BBQ, a mere four blocks east of the station.

Aside from that, there’s not much to see along the Purple Line. Not yet, anyway.

[img287 fullwidth]

The newest addition to Metro’s expanding fleet, the Expo Line – short for Exposition Line – will soon be the most accessible to UCLA students. The line is being extended out to Santa Monica, and Metro has plans to run express buses from Westwood down to the line.

It’s projected to be able to run from the ocean to downtown Los Angeles in about 45 minutes, which is unbelievable if you’ve ever sat in traffic on the 10 Freeway.

As it stands, the line is still pretty cool.

[img238 fullwidth]

It starts in the heart of Culver City's downtown district, which has a variety of trendy and chic shops and restaurants just blocks from the station.

Even closer is the Museum of Jurassic Technology. While it may sound like an homage to Jurassic Park, it turns out it's even cooler: The museum is dedicated to eccentric scientists and their inventions, packed together into this one itty-bitty building on Venice Boulevard.

Eventually, the line takes you to USC.

Forget USC, and exit the station to experience one of the most serene places in all of Los Angeles: the Exposition Rose Garden.

The garden is stunning, with 20,000 hedges, 200 different types of roses and picturesque gazebos. Not to mention that it borders the California Science Center, California African American Museum and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles.

[img232 fullwidth]

Continuing eastward, the Expo Line stops directly on Pico Boulevard, near two L.A. landmarks: L.A. Live (Staples Center included) and the Original Pantry Cafe. The Staples Center is very obviously the famous home of the Lakers and Kings (yes, you too Clippers), but the Original Pantry Cafe, which sits just a block or so north, is the real attraction here.

The Pantry claims to have never closed since the 1920s, and you hope it never does. It’s a throwback diner – complete with a cash-only policy. The reuben and breakfast are its specialty, but more important is the respect that transcends generations.

[img227 fullwidth]

Even the dim echo of the plastic water cups off the wooden tables creates a special sound – an earned sound, of age and wisdom. It’s a place that’s done and seen everything this city has to offer, and nearly a hundred years later, it still stands. The food’s good too.

[img288 fullwidth]

The Gold Line is the closest equivalent of the kind of shiny, modern public transit that people put on a pedestal in cities like Seattle or Portland.

But there’s a hidden facet to the Gold Line’s existence: More so than any other line out there, its route, from suburban Pasadena to East Los Angeles, is a microcosm of the city as a whole.

Let’s start with Pasadena.

Take the Gold Line to Del Mar station and you’ll disembark in Old Town, the heart of Pasadena’s tourism industry and the village Westwood wishes it could be.

Taking a stroll down Colorado Boulevard is tantamount to getting smacked in the face with ubiquitous charm and preppy architecture. There’s even the same mixture of nice-looking chain restaurants and niche eateries that Westwood has – places like Umami Burger, 800 Degrees Pizza, a fondue place called The Melting Pot and a bunch of pubs.

[img222 fullwidth]

Head south a few stops and you'll notice how quickly the chic bubble pops. Stop in Chinatown, just north of downtown Los Angeles and situated next to Chavez Ravine, home of the Dodgers.

It’s not Los Angeles’ first Chinatown – that was torn down to make room for (what else) a freeway.

Walk westward about two blocks and you reach the Chinatown Central Plaza. Draped with sky lanterns, the plaza is the central location for the best Chinese food and shops in the city.

[img229 fullwidth]

Heading further south, you reach Union Station once again, but close by is the Little Tokyo and Arts District area.

The Arts District is a little weird. The juxtaposition of brilliant artists in the warehouses-turned-studios and impoverished urban blight mixes in a strange concoction of Los Angeles’ industrial past and its artistic future. Also, Paul McCartney has a gallery there.

In Little Tokyo, you’ll find everything from Kula Sushi, Los Angeles’ oldest sushi bar, to the Japanese American National Museum.

Past Little Tokyo, the line turns east and crosses the depressingly depleted Los Angeles River before stopping at Mariachi Plaza in Boyle Heights. Boyle Heights is one the oldest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and originally heavily Jewish, but over the last couple decades it has become predominantly Latino.

Mariachi Plaza hosts regular concerts and events, and there’s some transcendent Mexican food available there – look no farther than Yeya’s Restaurant or Guisados, two local restaurants close to the plaza.

Walk a few blocks north and you’ll come to Hollenbeck Park. Bordered by South Saint Louis and East 4th streets, the park sits serenely in the middle of a blankly urbanized landscape, with a small pond, geese and an old bridge.

That, in essence, is the Gold Line. From the lily white suburbs of Pasadena to a neighborhood with one of the largest Latino populations in the United States, the Gold Line traverses a region of nearly 20 miles.

----

While there are other fascinating Metro lines that traverse our city (the Blue and Green Lines), these are the routes that are easiest for students to get to.

Even so, reaching Metro lines can be a challenge: You have to take a bus to them first, such as the 2 or the 720.

But bus riding aside, the best pitch I can make for the Metro is this: If you’ve ever been curious about the people and places that make up the urban ecosystem of 13 million people that is the greater Los Angeles area, it’s a good place to start.

Because it’s not what you see on TV that defines this city. It’s the people. It’s the lady on the bus studying for her citizenship exam, the reformed convict who’s looking for another chance, the mother of two on the Red Line, kids going home after school on the Gold Line, the lawyer who works in downtown Los Angeles but commutes on the Expo Line and sometimes, it’s just a guy and his girlfriend trying to get home after a Saturday night.

Yeah, you have your occasional obnoxious person who takes up four seats with all of his or her stuff. But mostly, it's the faces of the living, breathing people that call the city home, who are just trying to go about their day and do the best they can. Cars can insulate, but there’s nowhere to hide on a train.

So take a ride, and don’t forget: There’s a lot outside of Westwood.",6,""

For Halloween this year, I dressed up as Lorde.

It’s a pretty easy costume to pull off: All you need is some black lipstick, black hair dye and a piercing glare. But beyond the simplicity and affordability of the look – typical college student costume concerns – I think I gravitated toward Lorde for another reason.

Last year, after I was sexually assaulted, I spent the majority of spring quarter pounding Lorde into my head while hiding away on the upper level of Drake Stadium in between classes.

Turning her voice up loud enough drowned out everything else going on in my world and provided temporary solitude. I’d prop my backpack up against the concrete walls and lie on my back, head supported by my books, eyes closed. I’d just let Lorde pound through my brain until I couldn’t focus on anything but the music.

Listening to her music helped stop that terrible feeling you get in your throat in which you really want to cry but can’t get anything to come out – the insanely painful feeling of suppressed sadness.

I only ever get that feeling, that desperate need to cry, a couple of times a year. It’s an emotional state I reserve for only very special occasions.

As weird as that sounds – planning out when I’m allowed to cry – it’s more of a defense mechanism I’ve built to prevent others from having control over my emotional state.

[img301 left]

Once, when I ended things with a guy I was seeing, he called me an “emotionless robot, incapable of love.” I knew he was upset and that it was an offhanded (if not lamely worded) insult, but the statement hurt because it had a hint of truth to it. I’m closed off from my emotions because I don’t want others to have control over them.

Which is why I was in no way prepared to handle the reality that the person who assaulted me had cracked that defense mechanism and had total control over my emotional state, regardless of whether or not he knew it.

Lorde acted as barrier for a few weeks, standing in as my defense mechanism. But eventually, when my headphones were unplugged, and I couldn’t run away to Drake Stadium, I was forced to face the situation head on.

I tried to grapple with why the person who assaulted me had so much power over what I had previously thought was an impenetrable system of self-protection.

Tackling that reality started in my English class that spring.

[img253 right]

Right after I was assaulted, we read an excerpt from Judith Halberstam's book ""Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters."" The essay discusses how the concept of “monsters” has evolved into much more than the traditional depictions of grotesque, fairy-tale characters, and we contrasted this idea with the characters and depictions of monstrosity in ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.""

In her essay, Halberstam presents the idea that modern-day monstrosity is no longer a concept exclusively tied to images of deformed creatures that come out at night, emerge from underneath beds and are the farthest thing from human – essentially the exact way monstrosity is painted in ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.""

Conversely, Halberstam portrays monstrosity as encompassing the belief that monsters are among us, monsters are precisely human and evil “manifests itself as a seamless norm.”

The evolution of monstrosity that Halberstam seems to be alluding to is very closely tied to society’s ability to accept terror in forms beyond traditional portrayals of horror.

Sitting in class the first day we read her piece, I couldn’t shake the feeling that my experience with sexual violence was exactly in line with Halberstam's belief that monsters exist in everyday life, that they are all around us.

My experience with monsters directly challenges preexisting notions of monstrosity being confined to characters like Freddy Krueger and Frankenstein and others that evoke visions of deformity, terror and chaos.

[img297 right]

For me, the most terrifying monsters are utterly normal.

True monsters are the ones walking next to you on Bruin Walk, eating in Covel for Sunday brunch and presenting themselves as the farthest possible conception of what society perceives as evil.

My monster is such a monster: an evil that presents itself in the form of a UCLA student who passes for normal each day. He is a member of a UCLA fraternity, plays sports on the Intramural Field and enjoys B-Plate as much as the rest of us.

Though he fulfills the various standards countless young men at this school hold themselves to, he also meets Halberstam’s ideas of what new monsters look like.

“Monstrosity no longer coagulates into a specific body, a single face, a unique feature; it is replaced with a banality that fractures resistance because the enemy becomes harder to locate and looks more like the hero,” she writes, and this is exactly what this monster is.

He is the villain masquerading as the hero.

----

Calling yourself a victim is a demeaning task.

It’s a label that I would never assign to myself, or rather, never thought I would have to assign to myself. I hate that as I type out these sentences, they echo every personal account I’ve ever read on sexual assault.

The fact that an experience so diverse in context can trigger feelings so similar in individuals who have dealt with these monsters shows the incredible power of monstrosity to cross cultural, socioeconomic and any other type of societal boundaries.

For me, strange as this sounds, this recognition of evil as a cross-cultural phenomenon was a way to displace huge amounts of responsibility I had been pinning on myself. I was the one who had failed to recognize the monster who approached me on the dance floor, letting him kiss me and allowing evil to slither into my world without having to pass any barriers.

These monsters affect an individual’s ability to recognize horror. Without features like grotesque skin to serve as warnings, these monsters slip through cracks and evade recognition.

The power of society in shaping our perceptions of monstrosity is an interesting commentary on how we regulate our fears and horrors, only taking on fears we are ready to confront.

Rapists aren’t a new concept emerging only in the 21st century. Why is that we are just now deciding to label and classify them as monsters?

These monsters have been there all along.

In ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" there is a concerted effort to hide this glaring monstrosity, this monstrous disruption: a need to mask the terror when it emerges to prevent recognition of the evil.

But modern-day monsters don’t have to worry about being recognized as evil. Their invisible nature and complete ability to blend in with the rest of us destroy all barriers between what we believe monsters look like and what they actually do. Modern-day monsters thrive precisely on an ability to elude restrictions between their world of evil and our world of the ordinary.

Blasting Lorde until my eardrums hurt was a temporary fix to a bigger problem: It let me continue to ignore the real cause of my emotional distress.

I wasn’t upset because I’d failed to maintain a system of self-defense, and I wasn’t upset because I’d cried in front of my English class on the first day we read Halberstam’s essay, completely spooked by how relatable the words on the page were to my real-life experience.

I was upset because I’d been assaulted.

I was upset that someone could do that to another human being: rip total control and humanity from a person while masquerading as normal. For some reason, recognizing the true cause of the incredible aching sadness in my throat was the hardest thing for me to do.

But when I finally took out my headphones and allowed myself to feel – to be sad, mad, upset and angry – I was able to regain the control that had been stolen from me.",7,""

Dear reader,

Thank you for picking up our first issue of the school year. As the new year starts with three new editors, we want to show you a different side of Los Angeles, the city we all know and love.

Since the three of us are from outside Southern California, in this edition we pushed our limits beyond the concrete sidewalks of Los Angeles. We want to show LA through our eyes and some of the little ways it can reflect the great outdoors instead of the bustling city it is.

Some of these little oases are as close as UCLA's botanical garden or just a short drive away to Joshua Tree National Park. Two of our writers take us across the country and abroad with stories in Washington, D.C., and Rome. We visited a wildlife center and learned how to make an herb garden. There are personal stories of struggle and adventure.

We hope you enjoy our exploration of Los Angeles and beyond.

“No thanks, I’m not drinking tonight.” I pout. “Have class in the morning.”

As I pour Sprite into a red plastic cup to avoid further questioning, the taste of the white lie lingers on my tongue.

I am not drinking tonight, have not drank any other night and will not be picking up a beer anytime soon. But I’ve found myself uttering this half-truth more often lately.

“I don’t drink” takes one less word than “I’m not drinking tonight” – “I’m Muslim” takes two less – but explaining myself to a passerby feels too premature. Have they seen enough of me to view me as more than my religious adherence? Will they worry that I’ll judge them? Will someone judge me?

[img397 fullwidth]

While I feigned sleep to avoid strained conversation with a distant uncle, my ears perked up when he lowered his voice during conversation with my grandmother.

“Is she asleep?” he murmured. I’m not sure if he even knew my name. “I hope you won’t be offended if I say something about your granddaughter.”

My nani told him to go ahead. I anticipated his words like the prick of a needle while I laid in the car, awkwardly hunched.

“She’s at the age where it becomes important to dress modestly,” he began.

I squeezed my eyes shut, as if closing them hard enough would obstruct my hearing too. I knew very well what he was about to tell her – what the Quran says God would want – that it’s time to stop letting her granddaughter show her calves to his poor, innocent son. Frankly, at 14, I was already tired of this bullshit.

I am grateful to have been born into Islam and the culture associated with it; I have always valued the emphasis on morality in our holy book. In Islam, to advise someone toward a path of morality is considered an admirable act, and I know my uncle felt he was doing the right thing by advising me to cover up. I can’t tell this story without acknowledging his perspective.

But being made to feel that I – a 14-year-old girl at the time – had done something wrong by dressing as I had learned, was bullshit. Growing up learning that it was my job as a female to dress a certain way and then still failing to satisfy, was bullshit. Perpetuating a double standard that allowed my uncle’s son to expose his legs but sent me into a tizzy of moral self-analysis every time I stepped into a pair of soccer shorts, was bullshit.

What bothered me most was that the same source guided my uncle to what he thought was right and guided me to what I thought was unfair.

***

“Is your family religious?”

My mother was raised in a fairly liberal environment relative to most Pakistani women at the time. Although she was raised to dress to the standards of respectability for Pakistani Muslim women, my mother’s aversion to the hijab as a new-age religious trend was clear to me throughout my childhood.

Though my Muslim family attended large communal prayers to celebrate Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr for as long as I could remember, we seldom went to the mosque otherwise. My mother and I covered our limbs and heads to pray, but outside the mosque, she wore capris and wasn’t opposed to sleeveless shirts.

So the answer varied depending on who asked. We were religious to those who didn’t practice, but not to our fellow Muslims who prayed five times a day or our sisters who covered their heads daily.

As a child, the question threw me into turmoil because I didn’t understand why my parents didn’t make the effort to fast every day of Ramadan and pray daily, as mandated in the Quran. That was what I thought being religious meant, and I wanted us to be religious, because I had been taught that only those who fully fulfilled Muslim rituals were allowed into Heaven.

***

I think my mother views the hijab as the symbol for everything she cannot quite accept about Islam – in many ways, these are the same aspects of Islam that have become difficult for me to reconcile.

During my years in Islamic school, I excelled at memorizing passages from the Quran. After coming home beaming after successful recitations, however, my pride would be quickly crushed by what I now recognize as my mother’s own religious soul-searching.

“Why is the emphasis always placed upon the memorization of these words that you haven’t yet begun to even understand?” she would question.

And it was true. I was proud of the hours I had spent mastering the vocal inflections of Arabic, but I had no idea what the words meant.

Although her message brewed in my mind, a couple of years after the end of my Islamic school career, I decided I was going to pray five times a day. It was the least I could do – the least that was expected of me.

After a year, however, praying five times a day condensed into five speedy prayers recited before bed. The prayers became something I resented, a cursory ritual that I felt should’ve been more sincere.

I wanted to feel the love for God within myself that I had heard religious leaders talk about, the same affection and devotion for God that I saw peers of different religions and backgrounds embrace in a way I seemingly couldn’t. My resentment worried me, so I stopped praying.

***

Outside of Sunday school, I didn’t spend a lot of time with other Pakistanis or Muslims. I found the friends that I made in my public school easier to relate to than my Sunday school peers.

In high school, I clung onto the childhood values that taught me to stay away from drinking, dating and other things that I was still trying to negotiate the morality of. It wasn’t hard though – my friends and I were still as reliably innocent as ever. At the time, the only thing I felt differentiated my friends from me was the hemline of our pants – mine was always lower, except during soccer practice, on special occasions, at home or when it was hot.

As college approached, I was secure of myself and resolute in my values on an abstract level, but I was unsure of the specifics, like how much of my legs I could expose.

“You would probably go pretty crazy in college if you weren’t Muslim,” said a friend as we discussed our future in the summer before college.

The thought made sense to me. It was something that I had pondered – who I would’ve been without my culture and without my religion to guide me.

Yet the friend’s words bothered me. I felt that my choices and I were viewed as no more than the sum of my religion and my culture. Faced with choices I had never considered before, I still knew who I wanted to be, but I had become irrevocably conscious of how I was perceived.

At UCLA, I occasionally feel isolated at my place in the center of a Venn diagram between “stereotypical Muslim” and “stereotypical American college student.”

In some ways, my position has driven me away from confronting my religious doubts or participating in the Muslim community on campus. My reasons cycle. I fear judgment – the very same judgment I know I’m capable of passing and that my uncle passed on me.

I believe that community practice encourages my faith to focus on procedure and rituals rather than the morality and compassion that I find important. I want to develop my religious identity independently. But I’m not sure if I’ll find that devotion in time or if it’s my responsibility to actively seek it out.

Most of the time, I’m not sure what I’m doing with that cup of Sprite in my hand. It’s easy to say that the environment of rebellion coupled with a desire to fit in attracts me, but ironically, it feels like my feeble attempt to stick out – to not be limited by any part of me.

And when I do tell the whole story to someone who seems curious enough, or maybe just asks me at the right time, the inevitable comes up again: “Are you religious?”

The simplification of my own religious narrative into a yes-or-no question makes me realize I judge myself in a manner that I fear from others: calculating my religiousness based on how well I compare to the image of an “ideal Muslim,” one that I don’t even believe is necessarily the right one.

Every time I’ve thought about religion lately, it’s been to question my faith, to work through equations on what it means to be a good Muslim. I have focused a lot on whether or not how I practice is good enough, instead of the meaning of the practice itself.

I guess I am defined by my faith because I believe in God and am motivated by my faith to spread goodwill. I won’t drink, but I’m not sure if I think my level of skin exposure should mean something. I’m not ready to assert why I believe or why Muslims practice as we do, and I’ll never be OK with telling you that I’m right and you’re wrong.

Even if I'm still lost with that Sprite cup in my hand, I’ll say how I feel: Yeah, I’m religious.",27,""
95,11,Kobe Bryant: Beyond a Hero,kobe-bryant-beyond-hero,prime/winter-2016/lead/AYU_1463.jpg,There are three steps that always occur right after I dry my hands with a paper towel.,"There are three steps that always occur right after I dry my hands with a paper towel.

The first step is to crumple the paper into a ball. The second step is to find the nearest trash can and step back at least 10 feet. The last step – the most important of the three – reflects my childhood, my hero and my degree of idolization. I throw the paper towel while flicking my wrist as if it were a basketball. Then I shout as loud as I can, not caring about who will hear me or how people will perceive me, “KOBE!” I watch the paper towel go into the trashcan and I move on with my day.

My obsession with the Lakers and Kobe Bryant is only an extension of millions of others who bleed purple and gold in Los Angeles.

Here is an athlete who chose not to go to college, was accused of sexual assault and is described as selfish, self-centered and demanding.

Despite this, Kobe may be Los Angeles’ biggest hero. The number “24” is printed on jerseys across the city. Kids look up to him as a god. Some claim he is the best basketball player of all time. Others see him as a leader, the hardest worker to ever grace an arena.

I look up to Kobe a different way than most. He was more than my hero – he was my father figure.


***

[img421]

*On May 12, 1997, Kobe Bryant – a rookie at the time – was entrusted with responsibilities that a 15-year veteran would have been given. It was game five of the Western Conference Semifinal against the Utah Jazz. With a few seconds left on the clock, Kobe took matters into his own hands and attempted a game-winning shot. Not only did he miss, but it also ended up being an air ball. The game went to overtime, and Kobe added three more air balls in the extra period. The Los Angeles Times noted the way Kobe brushed this off: “Kind of water under the bridge. People around me, meaning the media and coaching staff, really looked at those shots as kind of being a turning point, so to speak. I just basically looked at it as giving me more confidence.” Nineteen years later, Kobe had hit more than 30 game-winners in his tenure as a basketball player.*

The truth is that out of the 8,063 days I have lived on this earth, I have only seen my father in person once, when I traveled to the Philippines two years ago.

Without a father figure in my life, there was no one to teach me about sports. No one to hand me a wrench to show me how to fix a car. No one to push me to take swimming lessons. No one to write a Father’s Day card to.

My mother was not interested in these things. She tried the best she could to be that father figure, but we both knew that it was different.

I’ve felt lonely on several occasions without someone other than my mom to go get advice from, and there were times when I would have no one to talk to about “male” things. There would be no Super Bowl parties hosted at our house or occasional Sunday barbecues.

But when people ask, “Do your parents allow you to do this?” or “Did your parents buy you that?” I always emphasize, “Yes, my mom did this,” or “Yes, my mom bought me that.” I dismiss the notion that my father plays a role in my life – using the plural of the word “parent” is an insult.

My mother moved to the United States alone when she was 29 years old, carrying nothing but a child in her tummy and a couple of bags, in order to give her son a life full of promise. At that point, my father was nowhere in the picture. My mother chose to raise her only child in Los Angeles, a city she heard was known for fulfilling dreams. While it’s true that this city might have had the resources to raise me successfully, there was and always will be one piece missing: someone I can call “dad.”


***


*In the summer of 2003, Kobe Bryant was accused of sexual assault on the night before a surgery in Edwards, Colorado. The accuser did not end up testifying, and a settlement was reached.*

*Throughout that year, Kobe lost the respect of the media and his fans. He lost endorsements from multiple companies. Calls of “adulterer” and “rapist” rang in visiting arenas, and the press surrounded Kobe with negativity the entire season. The Lakers fell short of a championship.*

*Kobe stated in an interview with GQ: “I’m Catholic, I grew up Catholic, my kids are Catholic – was talking to a priest ... he said, ‘Let it go. Move on. God’s not going to give you anything you can’t handle, and it’s in his hands now. This is something you can’t control. So let it go.’ And that was the turning point.""*

*After that year, he scored 81 points in one game, won Most Valuable Player in 2008 and surpassed Michael Jordan to become the third-highest scorer in NBA history. Now, he is portrayed in the media as someone with strong family values who takes care of his wife and two children.*

In “Life Without Father,” David Popenoe wrote, “Growing up without a father may be a root cause of many social ills – from crime to academic failure.”

There are other stereotypes about fatherless children: I would live socially awkward, I would not know anything about sports, I would not know how to live a life of leadership or manhood.

Was that the case though?

Just like how Kobe was labeled as a terrible role model, I faced the stereotype of how fatherless children end up. I didn’t want to fall into the stereotype. I tried not to be the stereotype. At the same time, I also did not want to admit that not having a father was a problem. I don’t usually talk about it.

To me, being fatherless became more of a challenge than a problem. It became more of a “throw yourself into the fire and see what happens” situation. I wanted to prove the doubters wrong, but mostly prove to myself that I could end up happy and successful.


***


*In the summer of 2004, Kobe Bryant was the center of all blame. Kobe and his partner in crime, Shaquille O’Neal, won three championships together, playing a dynamic and almost unstoppable one-two punch. But there came a point when their partnership turned into a divorce, and Shaq left Los Angeles via a trade. All fingers pointed to Kobe for Shaq’s departure. According to former coach Phil Jackson, Kobe was tired of being the sidekick, and others blamed him for his arrogance and unwillingness to share the spotlight. They said Kobe wouldn’t be able to succeed anymore after kicking Shaq out.*

*Despite all this criticism, Kobe was able to make it to the finals three times, win two championships and earn two Olympic gold medals after Shaq’s departure.*

Kobe taught me what it means to be a hard worker. Kobe taught me why success should be the only option. Kobe taught me what it means to be a leader, but at the same time, a facilitator – and one who can fend for himself. Kobe taught me that despite the hate, the bashing and the insults, you can still be the greatest.

These are all values that my father might have taught me. Nonetheless, these are values that I grew up with. I grew up being a hard worker, where success was the only option. I grew up being a leader and a facilitator who can fend for himself. I grew up knowing that no matter how many people bash or insult me, I can still strive to be great.

It’s the fact that Kobe is the first one in the gym and the last one to leave, that inspires me to work hard in everything I do. It’s the fact that Kobe plays through injury after injury – even shooting free throws with a torn Achilles – that pushes me to continue even after I fail. It’s the fact that Kobe gave gifts to his teammates when he won the Most Valuable Player award – because he thought he owed it all to them – that teaches me success is never accomplished alone.

I was able to overcome the common stereotypes of only children who grow up without fathers. I did not end up as an academic failure, or live socially awkward, or lack knowledge about sports. It wasn’t easy.

There are times when people around me, especially those in the Daily Bruin office, jokingly call me “dad.” I find that rather ironic but comforting at the same time. I’m glad to know that I can be seen as a father figure, even without having one in my life.

So thank you, Kobe.

Thank you for teaching me all the values that are overlooked by the media and the naysayers.

Thank you for inspiring me to be the hard worker that I am.

Thank you for being my hero.

Although you’re ending your basketball career, the impact you have made in my life will never be forgotten. I will remember it every time I succeed, every time I work hard and every time I wash my hands, rip that paper towel, roll it into a ball and spot a trash can. I will remember it when I yell loudly without any shame, “KOBE!”",35,""

Thick red bark twists around the tree’s core, stretching tall toward the forest canopy. Its rust-colored body is reminiscent of its cousins, the coastal redwood and the giant sequoia, which comprise the tallest and largest trees on earth. Fossils of the dawn redwood had been found strewn across North America in wide abundance, but scientists thought it to be long extinct. In 1944, however, one tree was discovered in China, revealing an isolated range where the species lived. Seeds have since been dispersed around the world. One now grows adjacent to a dense cluster of bamboo and a bench built in honor of a man who loved to play cricket.

Philip Rundel, director of the Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden, likes plants with good stories.

Tucked between Tiverton Drive and Hilgard Avenue, a vine-covered chain-linked fence defines the boundaries of the 7.5-acre botanical garden, which cultivates more than 3,000 of those stories. Rundel said he tries to take a walk through the garden at least once a day.

“It’s always fun to discover new things,” he said.

Sitting at a picnic table, Rundel took a sip of his Diet Coke. Signs posted near the entrance of the garden warn visitors not to feed the squirrels. The leaves of a Schefflera elegantissima provide shade over the patio. Now in his 48th year of teaching biology and fourth year leading the botanical garden, Rundel said he is still learning new things every year.

The garden has received many of its plants from local nurseries or other botanical gardens. Occasionally, Rundel said, they will salvage plants from nearby buildings that are in line to be demolished. Community members will sometimes donate plants they can no longer take care of. The dawn redwood’s seeds came directly from China. The garden now hosts a vast collection of plants from biomes that range from the desert to the tropical rainforest.

“What’s been exciting for me as a plant person, is this garden is full of subtropical things from Australia and southern Africa and Southeast Asia,” Rundel said. “There are a ton of things that I’ve never seen before.”

Much of Rundel’s work, he said, is focused on making the garden accessible for a wide community of students, staff and locals in terms of education and providing a wild space within the urban. Occasionally, a siren blares or a car horn blasts. Hammers and saws chime loudly behind the patio, as the La Kretz Garden Pavilion undergoes construction – a building which will serve as a new visitor center and classroom. From within the garden’s fences, however, one can barely see the surrounding rectangular buildings underneath the arboreal canopies.
“Physiologically and psychologically, when you go into a garden, things change,"" Rundel said. ""Your blood pressure goes down, your brain waves smooth out, your stress hormone levels go down.”

Evan Meyer, assistant director of the botanical garden, arrived at the garden in October after holding a position at the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, which specializes in native California plants. With this background, he is currently working to revitalize UCLA's own native section. The wide variety of plants as a whole, he said, is what made the botanical garden stand out in his eyes as a setting to teach about biodiversity and conservation.

“The vast majority of life comes from the energy produced by the sun that is captured by leaves. ... They’re the fabric of all life on our earth,” Meyer said. “There are so many different plants that once you become interested in them, it just makes the world a more interesting place.”

Meyer described himself as the plant equivalent of a car lover. When driving down the freeway, he said, someone might be able to identify a Mustang and describe the inner workings of its engine. For him, it's identifying a Mexican fan palm while walking through Westwood and being able to describe its origins in Baja California. Meyer said he’s always seeking out the wild landscape, whether it’s deep in the Amazon rainforest or in the sidewalk cracks of Santa Monica.

“(Plants are) the backdrop of everything from nature to cities,” he said. “And they all have a unique story.”

The Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden is open seven days a week to visitors ranging from art students to biology faculty to local community members. On any given day, students can be found scribbling in notebooks or parents can be seen having lunch with their children.

“Some people might walk through here and think, ‘Oh, it’s just like a nice park,’"" Meyer said. ""But it’s much more than that.""

The staff responsible for the daily maintenance of the garden, Meyer said, comprises a group of five people, other than himself, who can recite Latin names of plants, know how much water an obscure palm needs to grow, fix irrigation pipes and run tractors and chainsaws. Many have been working at the garden for over a decade or more.

“It’s not because we pay them big bucks,” Rundel said with a laugh.

## Cultivating the story

Before the La Kretz Garden Pavilion could start construction, all of the plants in the area had to be relocated. Burchellia bubalina, a wild pomegranate native to South Africa, was one of these plants many gardeners thought to be too large to transplant at the time. But Paul Galuska wanted to try. About seven months after uprooting and replanting, the shrub-like tree had lost every single leaf on its branches. Some told the gardener to take it out – it was dead. But he persevered, trimming back the branches drastically and giving it daily pep talks. Now, nine months later, several clusters of bright green leaves are emerging from woody stalks.

“That plant and I have a special bond,” Galuska said.

The botanical garden office is located on the first floor of the Botany Building, situated on the north end of the garden. Yellow Post-it notes label bookshelves stacked full of texts related to botany and gardening. Buckets sit on the floor full of stakes and green species placards, and cubbies hold a collection of tools and gardening gloves. Meanwhile, a potted plant soaks up sun by the window.

Joan Muench, senior garden manager and volunteer coordinator, sat in a swivel chair with a gardening knife strapped to her belt. A baseball cap with an embroidered logo for the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden rested upon a cluttered stack of papers by her side.

While Muench studied graphic design at UCLA, she had never heard of the garden that existed on the southern end of campus. Her career there first began on a Sunday in 1995. She had been taking a UCLA Extension course in horticulture when she met with the garden manager and asked to volunteer.

“There’s something very similar about plants to art,” Muench said. “There’s color, there’s form, there’s shape, there’s design.”

As a graphic designer, Muench said she designed brochures, retail catalogs, packaging for shoes, pots, pans, linens and more. The garden itself has its own kind of design, she said, as many of the plants are broken up into sections according to family or geographic location. When planting new species, Muench and the other gardeners take into account how tall or wide the plant will grow in relation to other plants nearby. Muench said the process and the plants have very therapeutic qualities.

“I think of our garden as sort of a little oasis in the midst of LA chaos,” she said.

On a day-to-day basis, she said the gardeners’ tasks are always different – they range from accessioning new plants to pruning, weeding and raking. Prior to volunteer days on Tuesdays and Fridays, Muench said she walks through the garden to pinpoint jobs for helpers to do. Most recently the work has gone toward planting more than 70 new plants in the California native plants section.

Galuska walked into the office then.

“Here’s one of our staff, right off the bat,” Muench said. “This is Paul. ... He started as a volunteer too, like me.”

Galuska was introduced to the botanical garden three years ago, but his affinity for plants began while helping his father maintain his rose gardens at their New York home.

“Me and my two brothers were the natural labor force for him,” Galuska said. “And so we – out of osmosis – learned a lot of stuff.”

He’d always been one for flowers, he said, and he continued to cultivate roses, zinnias and others that his daughters would cut, decorate with ribbons and sell in roadside stands. Galuska was trained in the Master Gardener Program at the University of Connecticut and eventually came to own his own landscaping business, before leaving the East Coast for California when his wife took a job with UCLA Health. While he lives in an apartment in Santa Monica now, he said he keeps a balcony garden and works part time at the botanical garden, maintaining the grounds, helping with volunteers and talking to his Burchellia bubalina, which grows alongside the garden’s service road.

“Did I tell you that we found a drainage pipe?” Galuska asked Muench.

“So that’s where the leak is?”

“It’s where the water’s coming from,” he said. “It’s probably picking up water from uphill somewhere, so we still haven’t found the leak.”

“This is what we have to deal with,” Muench said with a chuckle.

Soon thereafter, senior nursery technician John Cluff entered the office, a small Chihuahua trailing at his heels.

“And that is Helena, his little dog who is here every day with us,” Muench said. “She’s the mascot for our garden.”
Cluff calls her Sasquatch.

While Helena has been riding in her owner’s green garden cart for nearly nine years, Cluff started as a volunteer at the botanical garden 22 years ago. Rather than working with the plants, he said he is more attracted to the landscape, spending most of his time building pathways, bridges, water features and more.

“I think I could stand anywhere in the garden and see something I’ve worked on,” Cluff said. “I like creating a space that people can enjoy.”
Henry Varney, another senior nursery technician, has likewise held a long tenure with the garden, starting his relationship with the space as a student worker while attending UCLA in the 1960s. After a break, he returned to the garden again in 1992.

""Really my whole life to one extent or another I’ve been doing gardening,"" Varney said.

He said his mother took pictures of him as a toddler digging up the plants she had just planted in her garden. Occasionally, Varney will still dig up plants, but only if necessary.

“I somehow gravitated towards some of the physical labor that no one else wanted to do,” he said. “(I) was digging out stumps and things like that in various places in the garden.”

For Varney, the botanical garden provides a natural space not really accessible in the rest of UCLA’s campus.
“Little gardens, little patches of grass, a tree here between two buildings, OK,” he said. “But here you can actually walk through stuff. There’s dirt, it smells right and you can be part of nature.”

Muench expressed similar sentiments.

“I just like working with the staff and being outdoors,” she said. Catching Cluff’s eye across the room, she raised her voice: “I love working with the staff.”
“Don’t print that,” Cluff said. The room shared a laugh.

## Spreading the word

[img496 fullwidth]

For Hercules’ 11th labor, three golden apples had to be stolen from the Hesperides, daughters of Atlas. Ladon, a dragon with 100 heads, guarded the apples but did not survive his match with the demigod. When Hercules slayed the dragon, its blood spilled over the land, and from it rose trees with dozens of branches resembling twisted snake-like necks with sap the deep red color of blood. Native to the Canary Islands and the Atlas Mountains, the dragon tree grows in the sun-exposed desert section of the botanical garden, and its mythological wounds still seep through its bark.
Dorothy Jewell’s bench sits underneath the shade of the dragon tree. While she was enrolled at UCLA more than 10 years ago, she would often come to this spot to eat her lunch and fend off hungry squirrels.

Today, she serves as one of many docents in the Mildred. E. Mathias Botanical Garden, and she often brings visitors to this spot to tell them the tale of the dragon tree.

The docent program at the botanical garden is comprised of a group of volunteer naturalists that lead interpretive tours through the garden and teach people of all ages about its immense diversity and ecological intricacies.
A woman sat a picnic table with her son, who worked diligently on his spelling homework. Wendy Morris, the director of programs and tours, said hello and asked to join them.

Maggie Nelson, Morris' assistant, picked up a fallen leaf from the table and remarked on its pretty yellow and orange color. Another docent, Michelle Lee, a fifth-year geography/environmental studies and ecology and evolutionary biology student, identified the oak species without bothering to glance at the tree’s placard.

Each docent, Morris said, is trained to give a program with content of their choosing that functions as a reinforcement of Mildred Mathias’ legacy. Mathias, the namesake of the botanical garden, filled the garden with plants meant especially to create an educational space for the public.

“She understood ... that ethnobotany, the study of medicinal plants, is hugely important,” Morris said. “And as human populations spread out more and take up more land and plants are cut down, you lose things with great potential before they are recognized. So I like the idea that we’re preserving things here that might turn out to be important.”

With more than 3,000 species available to present on, Morris said the only challenge of creating a program is having enough time.
Nelson said she likes teaching the children and telling them stories about her own childhood memories.

“I tell them when I was their age, my teacher brought in a vase with these flowers, and I was so drawn to them,” Nelson said. “I could just remember the shapes. They were so unique to me. And then she told us the name – birds of paradise – and I remember thinking as a little child, 'That is the most perfect name they could have come up with for a flower.'”

Oftentimes, the docent program is asked to present specific tours. One third-grade class visits the garden annually for a unit on deserts. Once, local physicians requested a tour specifically of plants that cause allergies.

“Remember that tour with the blind fellow from England?” Jewell asked. “Wendy and I, we went around the garden thinking of things that smelled and things that you could feel.”

Because the garden is so diverse, Morris said the changing landscape is very teachable. Just moving from the desert section, where the sunshine is full, down the slope by the stream, the temperature difference is highly noticeable and allows for a tangible experience that can explain local adaptations, she said.

[img495 fullwidth]

“It’s fun also to just take 10 minutes to walk around and feel like you’ve been traveling,” Morris said.

Lee in turn likes to teach her visitors about the interconnectivity some plants share with the landscape – bromeliads, large and often flashy tropical plants, for instance, provide a food source for capuchin monkeys, a place for frogs to lay eggs and a home for a variety of insects.

“These plants are just so integrated in the ecosystem,” Lee said. “They provide the base of everything.”

When giving a talk to children, Nelson said she always asks how the garden makes them feel.

“I want them to really want to come back,” Nelson said. “That this is just the very beginning in their experience of what nature is and what an important role it can play in our lives.”

122,14,prime City Guide: Echo Park,prime-city-guide-echo-park,prime/winter-2017/lead/web.pr.cityguide.ER2.jpg,"","Nestled in between the looming skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles and the uber-trendy coffee shops of Silver Lake, Echo Park is a humble hybrid of the urban downtown scene and the laid-back vibes of LA suburbs. In Echo Park, many of Los Angeles’ most unique cultural facets come together to create a community that has a vibrant and distinctive energy. Riddled with vegan cafes, quirky thrift stores, Mexican fruit stands and bold street murals, Echo Park features a fusion of the city’s most beloved cultural staples. 

[img541 fullwidth] 

One of the most noteworthy aspects of the Echo Park area is the park of the same name, which has undergone renovations in recent years to clean up the water in the lake. The houses in the Angelino Heights neighborhood have made cameos in famous Hollywood media like the “Thriller” music video. And just a few blocks away is the renowned Dodger Stadium, where families and friends gather together for baseball games. From navigating the most culturally significant landmarks to scouting the artsiest eateries in the locale, prime highlights what this charming Los Angeles community has to offer.

## Echo Park

[img540 fullwidth]

The perfect place to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon, Echo Park is many Angelenos’ ideal escape from the hubbub of urban life. As I strolled around the perimeter of the park, I saw families pedal boating with kids in tow, millennial women jogging in Lululemon clothes and even a man meditating on the grassy knolls. Besides the family-friendly feel of the place, the park has splendid views that took me by surprise. The park’s lake overlooks the downtown financial district and blends sleek cityscape with beautiful greenery in a truly breathtaking way. Popular things to do here range from boating with the DTLA skyscrapers as a backdrop to sipping lattes from the park’s lighthouse-shaped cafe, Beacon.

## Carroll Avenue

[img552 fullwidth] 

The site of the haunted house from Michael Jackson’s epochal “Thriller” music video and the Halliwell Manor from the television show “Charmed,” Carroll Avenue has enjoyed its fair share of the limelight. Located in Echo Park’s Angelino Heights neighborhood, the street is lined with impressive Victorian-style homes that struck me as somewhere between breathtaking and haunted. Whether I was looking at the sprawling front porches or the quirky weathervanes, the houses made Carroll Avenue one of my favorite locations to sightsee because of their nostalgic feel and cultural significance.

## The Echo

[img550 fullwidth]

The venue seems inconspicuous at first glance; the beige exterior and humble marquee are overpowered by the colorful shops nearby. However, The Echo is a local favorite in terms of intimate concert venues. Although most of the shows are done by punk-rock cover artists, there have been some notable performers like Beck and The Rolling Stones that have graced the venue in the past. The disco balls on top and wall of beer on tap add even more allure to the lounge-like space. The Echo features cover bands almost every night for prices as low as $10 and is an essential part of the city’s nightlife. Although I did not get a chance to catch an under-21 show, the friendly staff and decked-out interior made attending a show here a new addition to my bucket list.

## Sage Organic Vegan Bistro

[img547 fullwidth]

Sage Organic Vegan Bistro is a quaint cafe tucked in the corner of a building on Sunset Boulevard that does not attract much attention from the outside. However, the shabby industrial space spruced up with ample greenery and mason jar light fixtures makes the interior a hipster heaven. Upon walking in, I smelled the distinct gingery smell of raw juiceries, which added to the ambience. I’m neither vegan nor vegetarian, which made me skeptical of eating at a vegan bistro. However, the fare is flavorful and delightful, not just for vegans but also for carnivores and everyone in between. My favorite item from lunch there was easily the hot wings dish. Made from firm, fried cauliflower doused in tangy buffalo sauce, these vegan buffalo wing alternatives will make even the most devout meat-eaters concede to their greatness.

126,14,The Importance of Letter Writing,importance-letter-writing,prime/winter-2017/lead/letter_illo.png,"","[img576 fullwidth]

Dear readers,

One of my earliest, fondest memories is receiving a letter from my great-aunt and great-uncle. They lived in the United Kingdom and were not overly fond of technology, at least as far as I could recall. They said the simple things someone says to unfamiliar family members: How’s school, how’s life, hope you’re well, come visit soon. It was simple, but it was in their handwriting. Reading that letter gave me a connection to my dad’s side of the family, a majority of whom I had never met. From that moment forward, I made every effort to give or send as many handwritten notes as possible – in gifts, letters or random notes to my dad before he left for work.

The history of letter writing is a rich one, ranging from romantic war correspondences to simple reminders to swing by the grocery store. Books of handwritten love letters have been compiled from various time periods, and stand as testaments to the feasibility of long-distance relationships. Writing by hand is a way of cementing memories, as numerous studies have shown. Why would sentimental memories be affected any differently?
I began writing letters to myself, and to my dad shortly after he passed away. It solidified what I could remember of him – and us – and helped me work through some problems that arose following his death. The act of writing something down, seeing it on solid paper and acknowledging that what was happening was real and couldn’t be deleted at the touch of a button was satisfying.

Studies done by Georgetown University have found evidence to link expressive writing to improvement in the attitudes of cancer patients – a study that I think could reasonably apply to other difficulties in life, as well. If those expressive writings happen to look like a letter, from which you can receive comfort and advice from a friend or family member, why not?

Handwritten letters can be more intimate than electronic or even verbal forms of communication. For one, there is more effort required to get a posted letter to someone. Stamps have to be bought, addresses collected and letters posted. You can even go the extra mile by finding personalized stationery. Emails are much easier – and faster – to send, which makes them more practical, but less personal. Alternatively, physical letters can be stored in a desk or an attic and felt, much in the way that a favorite toy or blanket can be felt.

But more than that, letters allow you to be in the room with the reader. Your handwriting is there, your scent – imagined or not – is there, something that you’ve physically held and written on is there. Letter writing is more than just sending words, it’s a way of being with someone that is too far to speak to in person. For the reader, it’s an insight into your consciousness, where you can exist in a mental space together even if you’re a continent apart. For the writer, it’s an opportunity to think about your life, to think about what first comes into your head when you want to tell someone something.

My junior year of high school, my language teacher handed out an assignment on how to write a letter. The process involved sitting down at a table, any table, and writing down whatever came to mind, whether it was what you did that day or a decision you had been mulling over. You could write to tell the person that you’ve been thinking about them or how you forgot about a meeting and had to run there. The important thing is taking the time to write a piece of yourself onto paper and send it.

Yours truly,
Lindsay Bribiescas

120,14,Yo Soy Quien Soy,yo-soy-quien-soy,prime/winter-2017/lead/webfullresAYEO0361.jpg,"","Ya eres mujer.

You’re now a woman, my mother explained to me after I told her I got my first period.

In my 22 years of living, my parents have trained me for my future: I am to be a mother who can cook and clean and remain pristine for my husband. I am to remain a pure virgin. Remain ladylike.

But I am queer.

As a feminist and closeted bisexual daughter of traditional Mexican parents, me quedo terca. I remain stubborn in my effort to better my relationship with my parents.

My parents grew up on small ranches in Mexico. They raised cattle and chickens and grew corn to make bread and tortillas. The life they knew was simplified to homemaking and cleaning for the women, and paid manual labor for the men until they each met a partner to have their children with. This did not leave much room for ways of life beyond their patriarchal and heteronormative culture.

My parents did not study past the sixth grade. They never went to a university to learn about the things they do not know, and they did not have the opportunity to socialize with the diverse set of individuals that colleges bring together.

But as I interact more with the LGBTQ community, I find it increasingly difficult to engage with them. For instance, I have a gender nonbinary friend who prefers to be referred to by the pronouns “they,” “them” and “their.” However, there is no equivalent translation for me to use when introducing my friend to my Spanish-speaking parents.

Fortunately, I have come to realize that talking about gender and sexuality can be done with a shared commonality: art.

## The art: Kerckhoff Walk-through

[img534 fullwidth]

Art is a universal language, but the ways in which you read it can be very much up to interpretation. This is why I decided to use the “queering” perspective, which involves looking at things through a lens of sexuality and gender.

When my parents come visit me at UCLA, we take walks on campus. Sometimes we find our way inside the buildings.

In Kerckhoff Hall, it doesn’t take more than 20 steps to come across the artwork of undergraduate and graduate students displayed on walls that span back decades in UCLA’s history. One particular painting, titled “Purple and Green” by an undergraduate student, hangs across the wall from the Graduate Students Association office and depicts four figures. Two of them, a dyad of purple and green, are facing each other and seem physically engaged.

In this painting, my parents and I alike are able to determine the figures as normal humans interacting in couples. But something else stands out: One couple is beige and brown, while the other couple is green and purple.

Besides these few details, the painting is otherwise less elaborate. The background is blank, the figures have no hair and they are neither clearly male nor female. This draws to my mind the parallels with the LGBTQ community: One the outside we are all the same, on the inside we just deviate a little from what is common. 

This piece of art allows for my queering eye to start a conversation with my parents about sexuality to someday help me explain to them that while I am attracted to both men and women, I am still the same daughter they raised.

## The artists: Barbara Kruger and Frances Stark
Heading south from UCLA and east on Wilshire Boulevard, we visited the Hammer Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, both of which have featured art I have been able to queer into my relationship with my parents.

Barbara Kruger, a conceptual artist known for her image and text pieces and a professor in the UCLA art department, produces art on topics of societal hierarchy, identity and sexuality.

The Broad Contemporary Art Museum building at LACMA features a large word collage on the big red elevator with Kruger’s work: “lipstick, cars, shop, hand bag...” These words give me an opportunity to start another conversation.

My parents speak very little English and can read even less of it, but they can see the words staring back at them in a big, white font. They ask me to translate the script for them and therefore allow me to share my interpretation, along with subtle societal criticisms.

“Lipstick” es una barra de labios, I tell my mother. I explain to her that the artist put careful attention on the object and what implications it holds in my parents’ and my shared society here in the United States: how the lipstick, when taken out of the context of a gender binary, becomes genderless. I tell her that I made a friend in college who identifies as a man and likes to wear makeup.

Growing up, my parents trained me to fit into a box labeled “woman” and threw in other things I apparently needed: makeup, cooking skills, the proper information needed to use a washer or dryer and how to get stains out of our living room carpet. Skills that are based on the assumption that having them would enable me to provide for my future husband and family, never allowing the possibility that he could someday cook for me too – or that I might not even marry a man.

My parents did this to both me and my younger sister. My parents also had two boys, each raised in their own boxes labeled “man,” ensuring they knew how to complete yard work and change a car tire.

My parents did not allow these items to get into the wrong boxes. Or white labels to be green and purple.

But standing in front of Kruger’s work, we are able to openly discuss what a “car” is and what implications it has: When I am babysitting my nephew – their grandson – they now understand that while cars are cool, dolls are also an acceptable toy for him.

At the Hammer Museum, we viewed Frances Stark’s “UH-OH” exhibit featuring the artist’s personal Skype conversations with men she had intimate relationships with while abroad in France. The work is titled “From Sexual Attraction Can Be Born An Idea.”

Though not queer herself, her art does push the boundaries of taboo and the appropriate. “So my sex cam story came about when I noticed, in fact, that I was writing all the time without realizing it,” Stark says in a promotional video on the Hammer Museum website.

The artwork depicts digital caricatures of people who are naked except for underwear. They are set on a green background and read Stark’s Skype conversation scripts in computer-produced voices. These artistic choices make it very easy for viewers to interpret the work in a way that resonates with them and allows room for personal interpretation, such as in my case as a closeted bisexual.

Stark’s relationships were with younger men, forming an atypical story that urges more conversations about these different kinds of intimate dyads.
My parents never talked to me about sex in my 22 years of life as their daughter. They did, however, tell me not to let myself get pregnant: No te vengas con tu domingo siete. But my young mind would think: But what about having safe sex and no babies? Or what about my sex life with the girls I had crushes on?

This installation allowed me to not only bring up sex as an adult to my parents, but also to discuss the variations in these intimacies, including same-sex relationships. While I have not been able to tell them about my interest in women, we can at least talk about lesbians in general.

I introduce them to the LGBTQ community without revealing my hidden identity directly. In doing so, we can objectively talk about the community’s struggles in families such as mine without the conversation becoming muted with the possible emotions that would come up during discussions with the unfamiliar.

Queer or not, I am their daughter and they brought me into this world. I am who I am. Exploring my potential realities and sexuality should be no less exciting for them as it is for me.

From cartoon characters to medleys of animal and floral prints, I love everything about Jeremy Scott’s bold, colorful designs.

But my favorite article of Moschino clothing unexpectedly doesn’t have any of its creative director’s signature prints on it. The main feature of that black quilted cap is just the word “Moschino” in gold block letters above the lid. It’s simple, but I knew I was smitten once I saw the hat atop Rita Ora’s head in her music video for “I Will Never Let You Down.”

I might have been a victim of clever and effective product placement, but that golden label gave me exactly what I needed to Google the cap and have it shipped to me in three to four business days.

Whether it’s signature patterns, logos or just the name of the brand spelled out, fashion houses have found a way to incorporate designs that are unmistakably theirs. These recognizable elements have also found their way onto college campuses through students’ monogrammed backpacks or logo-decorated shoes.

My girlfriend at the time, she had an MCM wallet and I just really digged the pattern, and when I came to college I saw it everywhere and I wanted one too. I started off with a cognac one, and I just got this black one.”
“I think it’s very appealing and also extremely recognizable.”

Those were the numbers Andrew Winn saw beside his name while he sat in the back of a squad car.
664: attempted. 187: murder.

[img560 fullwidth]

Winn spent 12 hours in the back of that car, his hands tightly cuffed behind him. The same hands that sent a man to the hospital with a subdural hematoma from which he would never recover.

Today, Winn is a fourth-year sociology student minoring in African American studies. He is the president of the University Apartments South Residents Association, an intern at the UCLA Community Programs Office and a member of the Justice Work Group. Next year, he will be pursuing a doctorate in sociology.

In 2016, Winn kept hearing Bryonn Bain’s name while locating resources on campus for formerly incarcerated students.
The pair had never met, but Winn did his research.

“One day he was walking in front of Haines Hall and I go, ‘Aren’t you professor Bain?’” Winn said.

Bain grew up in Brooklyn, New York, as the son of immigrants from Trinidad and Tobago. 

“I grew up in communities that didn’t have certain kinds of power that I thought we should have more of,” Bain said. “I went to law school to try to understand power.”

During his second year at Harvard Law School, Bain – now a UCLA professor – was arrested for a crime he did not commit. Bain spent five months defending himself in court, an experience that continues to impact his life.

In 1999 in New York City, Bain was arrested with his cousin and brother.

“Cops had gotten a call (that) shots were fired, and we were the only black and brown folks standing around,” Bain said.

Lani Guinier was Bain’s professor and mentor at Harvard. She encouraged Bain to submit the story of his arrest to The New York Times after he wrote about his unjust experience in her class.

“The New York Times editors called me up and said, ‘So this is a little racy for us, but why don’t you send it to The Village Voice,’” Bain said. “The Village Voice needed a cover story, and then it got over 100,000 responses.”

People across the globe reached out to Bain, many of them having faced similar injustices.

“People wrote in saying ... ‘They won’t believe us, but maybe they’ll believe you, because you have all them fancy degrees. All them overpriced degrees,’” Bain said.

Mike Wallace, a former correspondent for CBS’s “60 Minutes,” contacted Bain, who soon appeared on the show.

“Twenty million people saw that,” Bain said.

Bain got the name and badge number of the officer who arrested him and made degrading comments in the process, Bain said. Speaking out inspired many, but it came at a price.

“I started to have over a dozen cases of identity theft,” Bain said. “So clearly the cops had a reason to retaliate against me and someone was doing that very effectively.”

While working as a professor at New York University and teaching at Rikers Island, a jail complex in New York City, Bain was arrested again during a traffic stop for warrants that were out for Anwar Bostick, an alleged alias of Bain’s that he has never used.

“I was actually coming home from an awards ceremony where we won an award for grassroots arts and activism work in the prisons,” Bain said. “They arrested me for grand larceny and two misdemeanors.”

The police took him to a jail barge called the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center, Bain said.

“They put me on a prison boat off of Hunts Point in the Bronx named after the white folks who owned my ancestors,” Bain said. “What better way to say, ‘Boy, know your place.’”

Since then, Bain has channelled his experience into artistic outlets, such as his recurring one-man performance, “Lyrics From Lockdown,” and more recently his education initiatives at a women’s prison, where UCLA professors lead workshops and lectures.

Winn knew as soon as he met Bain that he wanted to develop their relationship. He took Bain’s class, African American Studies C191: “Microphone Fiends: Hip-Hop and Spoken Word,” in fall 2016.

Students were tasked with writing and performing spoken word, something that provided Winn with a platform to share his experiences. It was the start of a close relationship between the two, one that Winn said has developed to a level of trust and comfort.

“He values my social capital, which is not always the case, especially with somebody who has been (incarcerated) a few times like I have,” Winn said. “He really values what I can bring to the table. He listens intently to my ideas. He really pushes for me to get involved.”

[img556 fullwidth]

Today, Bain is the faculty adviser of Justice Work Group, a UCLA student organization founded in 2014. Winn joined last year.

“He immediately had this magnetism and energy about him that without even saying much to me ... I was immediately looking forward to how we were going to work together,” Bain said.

Danielle Dupuy, a doctoral student at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and a co-founder of JWG, said she helped form the group to create a forum at UCLA for students from different disciplines to discuss issues surrounding incarceration and the power of education for currently and formerly incarcerated people.

“We wanted to start something where we could have productive dialogue,” Dupuy said. “But also do some real work.”

Eric Henderson, a UCLA alumnus, introduced Winn to JWG. Henderson, who also studied sociology, said he thought Winn would be a perfect fit.

“He’s a great person, committed to helping folks out,” Henderson said.

Winn and Bain, despite the differing contexts of their incarcerations, are committed to working with JWG to reform the justice system that they have both experienced.

Drug addiction is where Winn’s legal troubles begin and end. His first arrest was in Glenn County, California.

“I moved out there because I thought I had to get a fresh start,” Winn said. “But the real problem was me the whole time.”

The arrests, too numerous for Winn to count, continued after his release. His first charges were for possession and being under the influence, but the crimes escalated as his addiction progressed.

“I needed to find ways to support myself because holding a job wasn’t enough,” Winn said. “I stole cars, I broke into cars, I broke into houses while people were sleeping in them. I would call them dope fiend crimes – things we would do out of desperation.”

This spiral began with property crimes, but the combination of living on the streets, a growing addiction and constant arrests altered Winn’s outlook.
“I’ve been woken up by being beaten with a metal rod before,” Winn said. “Living that kind of life, it’s like you abuse or be abused. ... At that point I was just like, ‘I’ll fight too.’ I fought, and I fought a lot.”

Violence became the standard in Winn’s life, not the exception.

“I used violence to get what I wanted,” Winn said.

In 2007, this approach would put him behind bars.

A friend of Winn’s told lies about him to keep his meth supplier happy, mainly accusing Winn of stealing from the supplier’s brother. The supplier brought a gun to Winn’s house only to find none of the allegedly stolen items. Winn confronted his friend.

“The guy started stuttering,” Winn said. “Because I knew him, I knew stuttering meant that there was a lie coming shortly after, so instead of waiting for that lie I just punched him.”

[img559 fullwidth]

The punch knocked his friend out, and his head hit the ground. Hard.

Winn gave his then-girlfriend and her friend money to take him to the hospital since he hadn’t woken up. Instead, the pair took him to a dealer’s house and blew meth smoke in his face to rouse him. It wasn’t for another 12 hours that the man was taken to the hospital, Winn said.

The man’s family didn’t know it was Winn who sent him to the hospital when he visited.

“The guilt just overwhelmed me, so I left,” Winn said. “He died two weeks later.”

His then-girlfriend told the case detectives – who were already familiar with Winn – what happened. A helicopter, squad cars and a canine unit arrested Winn at work.

“Needless to say, I never got my job back,” Winn said.

After spending hours handcuffed in the back of a police car, detectives escorted Winn to an interview room. Understanding his predicament, Winn immediately asked for an attorney.

“That’s what allowed me to be here today,” Winn said.

The district attorney sought a second-degree murder charge, which carries a sentence of 15 years to life in prison, Winn said. After studying similar cases and working with the family lawyer who came to the jail, Winn suggested an alternate deal.

Lengthy negotiations eventually made headway. Winn refused to take any deal involving the possibility of life in prison. The representative countered with a plea deal of involuntary manslaughter with a four-year sentence. Of that sentence, Winn served two and a half years: 18 months in county jail and one year in prison.

Winn credits several things as the starting points of his sobriety, specifically prisoner outreach programs within the Sacramento County jail. They included alcohol and drug addiction groups and counselors, classes with a family lawyer and ManAlive, a program aimed at ending domestic violence.
“I was still getting high in jail,” Winn said. “It wasn’t until I got to prison, and I did some drugs and I really reflected – ‘I feel horrible about doing this, and I actually know better now.’”

Aug. 27, 2008, was the last time Winn used drugs.

“All this was in me before,” Winn said. “Nothing has changed except for me addressing the issues that got me into those predicaments.”

That was the last time that Winn was incarcerated, but the impact of his time in jail and prison never left him.

Winn became sober one year before he was released from prison. Winn’s motivation to end the cycle stemmed from a letter he received from his father while incarcerated. His mother and father are foster parents of more than 20 years, as well as the primary caretakers of Winn’s two youngest siblings.

In the letter, Winn’s father wrote: “The only way you can truly be successful is if you find ways to give back to your community regularly.”
At Harvard, Guinier suggested that Bain take his unjust experiences and transform them into a hip-hop opera.

“I initially thought the idea was crazy,” Bain said.

He took his story and created “Lyrics From Lockdown,” a performance that marries hip-hop, spoken word, an Afro-Carribean form of music called calypso, classical music and comedy. The show utilizes a live band and a video DJ and debuted in 2013 at the National Black Theatre in New York.
The show was brought back to Los Angeles for a month of performances in February 2017, starting with an official UCLA opening night to bring awareness to JWG and raise funds for the creation of a center for justice.

Dupuy said a major mission of the group is supporting the creation of a center for justice at UCLA, to house a space for productive discussion and hands-on learning among students. It is a goal that Bain has been instrumental in developing, Dupuy said.

Bain’s prison education initiative is the catalyst for the creation of this center, she added.

[img554 fullwidth]

An ongoing series of classes at the California Institution for Women, a state prison located in Corona, California, brings UCLA lecturers and students into the prison. Bain has organized a series of faculty workshops and lectures with topics ranging from urban planning to biochemistry.

The creative writing class at the prison will culminate in a production this spring of “What It iZ,” an adaptation of the musical “The Wiz,” based on the experiences of incarcerated people adapted by women in the workshop, Bain said.

The show begins its two-day run March 17 at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Bain said the students in his “Microphone Fiends” class worked as the production crew and helped set up the event as a benefit for JWG and its center for justice.

“What’s magical about it is the language, the verse, the stories that are very now,” Bain said. “Everybody ends up in prison in the show.”

JWG also works within the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, a juvenile detention center in Sylmar, California. InsideOUT Writers, an organization that uses creative writing to reduce recidivism – the propensity of criminals to reoffend – hosts an annual retreat at BJNH where youths are able to share their poetry with an audience of friends, advocates and their families, Dupuy said.

The youths at the retreat are members of the Compound at BJNH, which holds juveniles who are being tried as adults.

“We were there,” said Winn, who attended the retreat in October. “We were smiling, trying to be happy for the kids presenting. It’s a tough pill to swallow. It was very emotionally draining to be able to relate to those kids who will be serving that type of time.”

Bain and Dupuy emceed the event, while Winn attended as a member of both Bain’s class and JWG. During his time there, Winn connected with one of the youths after learning he wants to be a sociologist.

“He told me, ‘I’m gonna get out one day,’” Winn said. “I just got done hearing a bunch of kids looking at 174 years to life (in prison).”
The pair exchanges letters and Winn said he plans to send him books to help develop his interest and mindset toward sociology.
“I gave him a quick rundown on my story and just kind of let him know that there’s still hope,” Winn said. “Knowing that you have a place in society is very important.”

Winn has proven to be an asset to JWG, Dupuy said.

“He’s amazing,” Dupuy said. “He’s always there and always presenting ideas. It just shows the strength of having someone (who was) formerly incarcerated in a leadership position.”

Dupuy said she was proud of Winn’s pursuit of a doctorate and hopes that he will be on the path to start a similar program at the graduate school he attends next fall.

“His story gives hope to all the youth I talk to now ... who can’t really see themselves going to that level of education,” Dupuy said. “Education provides a real pathway for a successful life, but also reduces recidivism immensely.”

Although no longer incarcerated, Winn says he will never again be truly free.

“Now I have mental health issues,” Winn said. “I wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares and heavy breathing.”

During one of Winn’s incarcerations, he witnessed a man being attacked while walking the yard. Two men with knives began stabbing the man, who managed to get the better of the fight, despite his puncture wounds.

Now, he feels a need to sit in corners, where he can be completely aware of his surroundings.

“There’s a lot of narrative right there,” Winn said. “You have to persevere. Your life depends on it. And then the other part is the realization that the guys who did it were this man’s friend the day before. ... It’s business.”

Winn’s experience in Bain’s class allowed him to address the mental health issues he developed while incarcerated.

“Being able to write (about my mental health issues) and say it in front of other people is really helpful with the healing process,” Winn said.
The necessity for reparative law is clear, but it needs to be reformed, he said.

“I do know I owed something,” Winn said. “I don’t feel like I owed a lifetime of agony through mental health conditions. I don’t think I deserve having to explain myself every time I’m up for employment. I don’t think I should have to explain myself every time I apply to grad schools.”

The political suppression of currently and formerly incarcerated people is what Winn said drives him forward.

“I’m willing and I’m ready to fight,” Winn said. “Being a part of JWG, being able to mentor men and women like myself, the children that I work with who are facing life sentences, all of them, it’s going to take somebody like myself to make the change.”

His education will help him in the fight, Winn said – but his experiences, too, guide him and push him forward.

“When I was released from prison, one of the things that crossed my mind was that they just released a motherfucker.”

I walked back from class, my hair damp with sweat beneath the fabric covering my head.

A group of students scattered across Bruin Walk handed out flyers and stopped each person that passed by to passionately discuss their civil rights campaign.

“Support marriage equality!”

As I walked by, every single one of them avoided making eye contact with me. 

On one hand, I was glad to be left alone because being approached by strangers makes me uncomfortable. At the same time, I was upset. Given how enthusiastic the people flyering were, their avoidance of me felt like an assumption, based on my appearance, that I would never support marriage equality.

I wear a hijab.

Colloquially, “hijab” is used to refer to the headscarf many Muslim women wear. On a more technical level, “hijab” refers to Islamic standards for dress and behavior, which emphasize modesty and dignity. I choose to cover my hair because I believe it is one part of this larger set of standards.
Sometimes when people look at me, all they see is my headscarf. To them, I am not a UCLA student; I am not a feminist; I am not an editor at the Daily Bruin – my identity is reduced to what they surmise from a piece of fabric on my head.

These are the same people who stop me to ask my opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to ask me what makes Islam better than Christianity, to start up religious debates with me.

Don’t get me wrong – I am happy to answer questions about why I personally decided to cover my hair and what it means to me. In fact, I also enjoy discussing a myriad of topics unrelated to religion. But when I’m suddenly expected to explain and defend my beliefs while I’m going about a normal day on campus stressing about midterms, I get a little frustrated.

The fact of the matter is that I am not an authority on Islam, nor do I know much about religious politics. My open display of faith is by no means a declaration of expertise on the subject.

*** 

I leaned into the conversation, absentmindedly tucking back a strand of hair that had escaped my headscarf as my friend told me about her relationship with her faith.

She told me about how she believed in Christianity as a religion but followed the teachings of Buddhism in her day-to-day behavior. Since I regard Islam as both my religion and my guidebook for daily life, we compared the teachings of Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, finding several similarities among the three faiths.

[img574 fullwidth]

Sometimes the subject of religion will come up while I’m casually speaking with my friends. I enjoy learning about other people’s religious beliefs. It is interesting to hear what others – whether they are Jewish, Hindu, atheist or anything else – think of spirituality.

What I do not enjoy is how some people seem to close up while talking to me about their faith, as if I will somehow look down upon their practices simply because I am so obviously spiritual.

A Muslim friend once came to me for advice. She was having trouble completing her five daily prayers and was wondering if I had any suggestions to get her back on track. While telling me her feelings about the matter, she kept interrupting herself with phrases such as, “I’m sure you always pray on time,” and, “Please don’t think badly of me for this.”

I was flattered she trusted me with such a personal matter, but I was also saddened by how embarrassed she felt while telling me her story. Contrary to what she thought, my ability to give her advice on the subject came not from my supposed religious authority but from my prior struggles with the very same thing.

She had nothing to be embarrassed about in front of me. Although I wear a headscarf and she does not, I did not feel religiously superior to her in any way. I knew that, although she was having trouble praying, she showed her religious devotion in other ways. They just were not as visual as my headscarf is.

Nobody ever asks me about how strong my faith is. They look at my hijab and think that somebody who is willing to put her faith on display like that must be religious.

I wonder if anybody has ever considered that maybe I am struggling with my faith. Maybe there are things about faith that confuse and elude me. Maybe I could occasionally use their religious advice rather than the other way around.

Because sometimes I am confused, and sometimes I do struggle with my faith.

***

The barista took my order, glancing away as I adjusted my scarf.

I am not normally a self-conscious person. I do not usually spend time thinking about what others think of me, what they think of my headscarf.
But sometimes I cannot help but think about what the woman in the elevator sees when she glances at me and quickly looks away throughout our brief trip together, or what that parent thinks as he hurriedly pulls his child away from the good-natured staring contest we started at the grocery store. I cannot help but notice the car that was idling in the Luskin Conference Center turnaround speed up to pass me and then slow down to ask the person three feet in front of me for directions to Pauley Pavilion.

Then I start to wonder if my behavior seems too aggressive. I have never been very bubbly or friendly around strangers, but I start to wonder if I should change that. Should I have smiled more when I ordered my chai latte? Could my walk somehow be calmer?

Most of the time when I start thinking these thoughts, I am quick to laugh at my foolishness. Why am I thinking about whether my walk is too aggressive? It is ridiculous to think that I should make myself less assertive because of how I dress.

However, there are times I cannot shake these thoughts so easily, because I know there are people out there who consider my every action to be offensive simply because I wear a piece of fabric around my head.

California is so diverse that it is easy to forget how foreign the sight of a woman in a headscarf is in certain parts of the United States. I once visited a smaller city in the Midwest for a wedding, and I will never forget the reaction I received as I stepped off the plane and into the airport. I was simply walking toward baggage claim, but silence and stares followed in my wake.

I could stop nearly all discussion and movement in an airport terminal with my presence. The United States is the only home I have ever known, but in that moment I had never felt more like I did not belong.

I had never felt more powerful, and I had never felt more powerless.

*** 

For me, wearing a headscarf can be a heavy burden to bear, but not for reasons people usually assume.

I have Muslim friends who simply cannot bear the thought of covering their hair. They think it makes them look ugly and cannot get past that. I have Muslim friends who are afraid they will be attacked or discriminated against if they wear a headscarf.

While I can appreciate these concerns, they have never been issues I spent much time worrying about, and I do not think of them as the true burden of hijab.

For me, covering my hair can be difficult because it puts me up on a pedestal I do not want. It seems to imply some sort of moral superiority or religious authority I do not have. I am simply trying to practice my faith in the way I know how.

In my eyes, donning a headscarf every morning is a commitment I am making to myself to continually strive to better my character. It is a reminder of who I am and what I believe, a reminder to uphold my dignity and self-respect in all my actions.

Yes, hijab can be a burden, but over the past six years, it has become an integral part of my identity. Not wearing it would feel stranger than wearing it.

I used to wonder how my life would be different if I had never started covering my hair. Would I care more about my appearance? Would I be more outgoing? Would I have more friends?

This is where I often stopped myself.

I reasoned to myself that if someone were not my friend because of my hijab, they probably were not a friend I needed anyway. I have made many friends through my headscarf, either because they knew what it meant or because they did not and wished they did.

Looking back, I must have spent hours thinking about how my life might be different, never reaching a definitive answer because it simply is not possible to determine all the ways hijab has affected my life.

But who knows? It is not something I waste time thinking about anymore.

Because an Umbreen who wears a headscarf is a truer version of myself than an Umbreen who does not wear a headscarf. And I cannot be apologetic about that.

124,14,Introspection,introspection,prime/winter-2017/lead/AYEO0129.jpg,"","For four dancers, performance is introspective. It’s a way to explore how the world influences us, how much say we have in that influence and whether it changes us for better or worse. Morgan Hood and Natalee Palmer criticize the power discrepancies between white women and women of color and how media depictions and societal expectations influence what their ideal bodies should look like. Madison Olandt and Michelle Olson examine how someone’s outward representation impacts how they are perceived. Do their self-representations aim to deceive? If so, for whose benefit – their own, or others’?

## “The Seed”

[img598 fullwidth]

In their piece titled “The Seed,” Morgan Hood and Natalee Palmer capture the overlap of several social identities, including gender, race, class and sexuality. Media depictions and societal expectations planted in Hood’s and Palmer’s minds color how others view them, Hood said. The two dancers restrict their torsos, thighs and upper arms with Saran Wrap to appear thinner – a criticism of the heavily edited photos of women that appear in advertisements and magazines.

Hood and Palmer, both fourth-year sociology and dance students, studied different cultures’ idealized body images in Sociology 156: “Race and Ethnicity in American Life.” For example, ideal black bodies are curvy, while white bodies are thin, Palmer said. She added she and Hood frequently perform together and are often called twins, but their experiences in the job market differ because of the colors of their skin.

[img566 fullwidth]

This moment in the routine is telling of the racial conflict between the dancers. Palmer pulls at Hood’s clothing, capturing her desire to fight back and disrupt Hood’s authority over her. Both dancers begin to expose the Saran Wrap under each other’s clothes, revealing their insecurities about ideal female body images.

[img561 fullwidth]

Hood and Palmer begin their performance in a position that highlights the racial divide between the black body and the white body, Hood said. Palmer, with her hands up, symbolizes racial violence against people of color.

“The position demonstrates a dependency that (Palmer) has on me, a white female,” Hood said. “The halo around my head is a powerful symbol of not only the power I have, but the problematic feeling of righteousness.”

[img562 fullwidth]

Throughout the dance, Palmer consistently executes moves that require more strength. Palmer said the choreography reflects real-world expectations, because black individuals need to do more to achieve the same recognition as their white counterparts.

[img564 fullwidth]

By the end of their performance, the narrative comes full circle – Palmer stands strong and victorious while Hood lies in a restrictive, diminutive position, Palmer said. Both dancers strike sexualized poses, with their backs arched, legs bent and chests out. Their clothing has been cast aside, a commentary on how male attention is awarded to women who show more skin. The halo now encircles Palmer, who appears to have found mobility in embracing her sexuality.

“Black individuals need to do more to achieve the same recognition as their white counterparts.”

## “Division”

[img571 fullwidth]

Madison Olandt and Michelle Olson use their senior dance project as an opportunity for self-reflection. Their performance, titled “Division,” tackles questions about social perception and deception.  

Olandt, a fourth-year psychology and dance student, said her experiences in two contrasting worlds – academia and dance – led her to question how she was allowing her environment to change who she is, in her own eyes and in others’. How do we distinguish between adapting to our surroundings and being molded by them?

Olson, a fourth-year anthropology and dance student, said she struggles to make time for introspection. Through this performance, she asks herself to let go – to loosen the reins and allow for more balance between the way she wants things done and the external influences in her life.

[img568 fullwidth]

During their performance, Olandt and Olson’s legs and feet form triangular shapes. Olandt said the triangles, symbolic of change, represent how their environment is constantly in a state of transformation. Olson added individuals are never stagnant because they continue to be influenced by new environments and people who surround them.

[img567 fullwidth]

Olandt said the two dancers represent the duality in everything, but Olandt and Olson are not foils for each other. Olson said they aim to complement and balance one another – two parts of the same whole.

[img596 fullwidth]
Olandt appears to fly over Olson, their arms mirroring one another’s. Olson said this moment in the routine highlights the importance of staying grounded in who you are despite the constant external energies that push you to change. Olandt added it can be easy to lose yourself in the opinions of strong people who enter your life.

As the pitter-patter of precipitation hits the roof of my apartment, it seems that Southern California has taken a break from its sunny-day repertoire. Lately, with all the rain that has struck Westwood and all the beach days that have been canceled, I have been revisiting childhood rainy day crafts. However, I’ve had to tweak them a bit to fit into this new adult-ish life and provide a functional use in my apartment. 

Doughnut coasters – an ode to one of my favorite frosting-covered pastries – are just that. On one hand they’re useful to have around, limiting the number of rings left on the table after a Thursday night. But they also retain a bit of childhood whimsy, looking like colorful little doughnuts. 

They are simple enough to create – even for the artistically challenged – and add a bit of character and class to any college dorm room or apartment. 

So on one of the many rainy days this quarter, I set out to make a set of doughnut coasters. Upon completion, I immediately put them to use as I sat and drank my hot chocolate while watching the rain streak down my window.

## Materials

[img593 fullwidth]

Set of round cork circles
X-Acto knife 
Paint brushes
Assorted acrylic paints 

## Instructions

[img592 fullwidth]

Trace the center of the doughnut. I used the bottom of a pod for a Keurig coffee maker as a stencil to cut out the hole. A quarter or a shot glass would also do the trick.

[img591 fullwidth]

Cut out the doughnut. Before using the X-Acto knife, be sure to put something underneath the coaster to protect the table below. I used cardboard.
Paint the icing of the doughnut. I like strawberry doughnuts so I painted it pink, but feel free to use any other colors.

[img590 fullwidth]

Paint sprinkles on the doughnut (optional). I doughnut think any doughnut is complete without sprinkles, but that’s just me.

Heat up a mug of hot chocolate and enjoy!

Think pumpkin spice lattes. Think expensive tickets to Halloween Horror Nights and the unoriginal costumes that populate frat row in October – that’s probably the Halloween aesthetic a student in Los Angeles has been conditioned to expect.

Now, picture real pumpkins. Imagine the aromas of hot apple cider and freshly baked pie drifting through a chilly autumn evening, blending in with the smell of hay on a dusty farm. Think corn mazes, hayrides and homegrown haunts in the driveways of rustic mansions – that’s what an authentic Halloween experience is to me.

Based on elaborate costume parties, theme-park attractions and professional, high-budget haunted houses run by film studios, the typical Halloween in Los Angeles has always seemed glossy to me.

But growing up in Connecticut, I spent my Halloween days outdoors in orchards, cornfields and pumpkin patches. My nights were spent visiting makeshift haunted mazes with homemade props set up in actual forests. To me, the holiday represents a time for the community to experience a frightening atmosphere, not only in haunted houses but also through the anticipation surrounding Halloween.

New England’s natural setting lends to a spookier autumn. In smaller towns with colonial histories, vintage homes are scattered in and around acres of scarlet forest. A thick layer of mist blankets the ground in the mornings, blocking all visibility. Occasionally, you’ll hear a wolf’s howl in the distance – being on the East Coast in the month of October felt like being thrown into a horror movie.

Though I obviously can’t blame Angelenos for this difference, being surrounded by palm trees, soaked in sunshine and blessed with views of the beach doesn’t really match up to watching the leaves turn orange and fall off the trees. 

Ty Botts said Halloween is a family- and neighbor-oriented occasion in his Pennsylvanian hometown. The second-year pre-business economics student said one of the town's big Halloween attractions is a parade going down Main Street that scatters candy for the children. 

Margit Maple, a second-year civil engineering student, used to pick pumpkins from a patch, carve them and then bake the seeds when she was growing up in Maryland.

During her first year as a student at UCLA, Maple bought pumpkins from a store and painted faces on them. However this year, Maple hopes to convince her roommates to go to a pumpkin patch and actually carve jack-o'-lanterns.

This October, I also committed to recapturing the traditional East Coast flavor with seasonal activities in Los Angeles.

I learned about Tapia Bros. Farm, an family-owned estate in Encino, California, and decided to give it a try. With a pumpkin patch, a corn maze, a petting zoo and hayrides, the venue seemed to offer the essentials of East Coast Halloween nostalgia. 

[img659]

I arrived at the farm’s pumpkin patch, only to realize that it wasn’t actually a pumpkin patch at all: Rows of pumpkins were layered over what felt like a parking lot with dirt poured over it. Instead of growing on vines embedded in the soil, the fruits had been prepicked and laid out for customers to simply pick up and check out, depriving me of the experience of cutting the pumpkins off their vines and hauling them out of the patch in a creaky old wagon.

Despite its makeshift setup, the farm’s miniature collection of farm animals and familiar smells of hay barrels and freshly roasted corn on the cob reminded me of my former home and warmed my heart. 

Tapia Bros. Farm also provided more pumpkin varieties than I had ever seen together in one place. From the classic orange jack-o'-lantern and Cinderella pumpkins, to the more exotic looking gourds in shades of green, yellow, brown and white, the site sold an entire spectrum of pumpkins.

Confronted with both similarities and drastic differences from my East Coast experience, I decided the real test would be the corn maze across the street from the main farm. 

I entered, map in hand, with a bottle of water to beat the heat – I’m used to 50-degree Octobers. Towering cornstalks seemed to stretch on, but with palm tree tops peeking out from the distance, it wasn’t hard to remember that the maze was a shockingly small four acres.

As a kid at my local corn maze in Connecticut, I remember being faced with the legitimate fear of being trapped among the cornstalks overnight. Although the limitedness of the expanse and the sweltering heat were constant reminders that I was in Los Angeles, the experience was familiar enough for me to evoke East Coast nostalgia.

Part of the heightened eeriness in Connecticut around Halloween is because of its history. Second-year atmospheric, oceanic, and environmental sciences student Liesl Schleusener said the tradition and history behind Halloween in her home in North Carolina made the holiday feel far more authentic and spooky. Towns on the East Coast are often older, and the commonly told local Halloween tales create a more convincing haunted feeling.

Schleusener, whose family moved to California two years ago, also said Halloween in Los Angeles lacks the buildup it has back east. She noticed Angelenos observe the holiday the day of, but folks in her hometown begin getting into the spirit of fall weeks before Oct. 31. 

When I saw the spider webs and Styrofoam gravestones go up in front yards, I knew my favorite time of the year was around the corner. It was my cue to immediately purchase tickets to haunted houses, both the low-budget ones in the basement of our local middle school and the more professional ones that took place in forests or farms.

This year, I went to the Los Angeles Haunted Hayride, a collection of mazes set within the hills of Griffith Park. I chose this venue because of its natural setting, which provides the element of unpredictability unlike most Los Angeles haunted mazes that take place in Hollywood studios or theme parks. 

Stepping into a clearing between the woods at the hayride, I was surrounded by clouds of fog which spewed from the many fog machines scattered around the venue and accurately recreated the forest haze of South Windsor, Connecticut. Hundreds of jack-o'-lanterns, many of which were stacked up in an impressive tower, illuminated the whole site in an orange glow, giving the trees a hellish aura.

Shortly after arriving, I sat down on barrels of hay to drink hot cider and crunch on caramel apples, flavors that instantly brought back memories of picking baskets of my own apples and turning them into applesauce. Occasionally, I would get startled by the killer clowns roaming the vicinity and pose with some of them for photos.

Finally, I boarded the hayride, which took me through around 20 different scare zones, each with different themes and monsters, including a circus-themed area with clowns and a graveyard setting with zombies. In addition to the main hayride attraction, the venue offered two other mazes: a Halloween village with multiple “haunted” homes, and a pitch-black maze with strobe lights that made the walls seem like they were slowly closing in on the participant.

Leaving the Haunted Hayride, I realized that this fall has been one of the most fulfilling one in years. When I left Connecticut, I was spooked by the thought that I might never experience a ""real"" fall again. But being in Los Angeles didn't stop me from recreating Halloween the way I like it.

Maybe I can accept palm trees instead of frightening forests for Halloween after all.",83,""
127,14,Recipe: Nanaimo Bars,recipe-nanaimo-bars,prime/winter-2017/lead/web.pr.recipe.4.HB.jpg,"","[img579 fullwidth]

Since moving to Westwood, there are few things I’ve missed more than my mother’s baking.

Although cookies and cupcakes are great, there’s a harder-to-find dessert I crave even more: Nanaimo bars. The three-layer treat originates from Nanaimo, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island, and has not spread far beyond its Pacific Northwestern roots. With a base layer of graham crackers, almonds, coconut and cocoa, a middle layer of custard and a top layer of chocolate, Nanaimo bars are the stuff dessert dreams are made of.

The only reason I’ve been exposed to them is because my mother grew up eating them and then passed them down to me. Without the ability to buy them at my local supermarket, I’ve turned to making them myself when I want a reminder of my family. When the smell of chocolate fills the kitchen, it takes me right back to when I was younger.

[img585 fullwidth]

Recipe adapted from nanaimo.ca.

## Bottom layer
½ cup salted butter
¼ cup sugar
5 tablespoons cocoa
1 egg beaten
1 ¼ cups graham cracker crumbs
½ cup finely chopped almonds
1 cup coconut

Melt the butter, sugar and cocoa in the top of a double boiler. To make a double boiler at home, place a glass or metal bowl on top of a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the bowl does not come in contact with the water. Add the egg and stir to cook and thicken. Remove from heat. Stir in crumbs, coconut and nuts. Press firmly into an ungreased 8-by-8-inch pan.

## Middle layer
½ cup salted butter
2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons cream
2 tablespoons vanilla custard powder (Note: This can be hard to find in the U.S., so I used vanilla pudding mix.)
2 cups powdered sugar

Cream butter, cream, custard powder and icing sugar together well. Beat until light. Spread over bottom layer.

## Top layer
4 ounces semisweet chocolate 
2 tablespoons salted butter

Melt chocolate and butter over low heat. Once cool, but still liquid, pour chocolate over second layer and chill in the refrigerator. The bars can be served at room temperature, but I prefer them straight out of the fridge so the custard doesn’t melt.

129,14,Letter From the Editors,letter-editors,prime/winter-2017/lead/DSC_6551.jpg,"","Dear readers,

Thank you for picking up prime’s first issue of 2017. The start of the new year has brought many changes – the United States has a new president, the sunny Los Angeles climate includes rainy days and the Daily Bruin office is now slightly smaller. With these changes come new stories and opportunities to reflect on past experiences and assess personal identities.

The stories in the following pages show the different worlds and perspectives of people at UCLA. We get a taste of the ongoing struggles faced by people who were formerly incarcerated and the changes they strive to make. We show how one uses art to explain the LGBTQ community to those who may not understand it. We uncover the thoughts that lie beneath a Muslim student’s hijab. We watch dancers explore beauty standards and internal emotions through choreography and read a testament to the almost-lost art of letter writing.

Additionally – not forgetting prime’s own traditions – we give you the tips needed to make a chocolatey dessert native to Vancouver Island and explore Echo Park, a small piece of LA’s geographic identity.

Though you may not identify personally with the stories we tell, we hope they give you new insight into our diverse and changing world.

With love,

Hayley McAvoy, Maryrose Kulick and Youngjun Park

132,15,Recipe: Empanadas,recipe-empanadas,prime/spring-2017/lead/web.prime.recipe.picK.jpg,"","When I first bit into the flaky pastry, I was utterly disappointed.

I was in a summer cooking class with a gaggle of other third- and fourth-graders and couldn’t have been more excited to be cooking something I had never heard of before: empanadas. But unfortunately, the recipe had clearly been dumbed down for the palates of picky little children like me – it didn’t taste much different from the plain beef and potato pies that I ate growing up in my own home.

It wasn’t until after I became a vegetarian eight years later that I would try empanadas again. I was at a summer food festival with my family, sunburned and sweaty under the sizzling Sacramento sun, when I stumbled upon an Argentine empanada food tent. To my surprise, they had a vegetarian mushroom and cheese option, filled with sweet caramelized shallots, rich mozzarella and ricotta. It tasted exactly how you’d expect a fried, cheese-filled pastry to taste – greasy, heavy and rich. But most of all, delicious.

Here’s my attempt at recreating that savory treat. I took a couple of liberties with the recipe, adding nutmeg to the filling as it adds a sweet and bitter touch that pairs beautifully with ricotta cheese, and baking the pastry instead of frying it simply because it’s a much easier and cleaner method of cooking. But despite those changes, it’s still just as tasty and filling as the pastry I consumed on that scorching hot summer day.

[img617 fullwidth]

Filling:
1 cup brown mushrooms, sliced
1 shallot, sliced
1/2 cup spinach
1/2 cup ricotta
1/2 cup mozzarella, shredded
1 pinch nutmeg
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
Pastry:
1 1/3 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening or cold butter
3 tablespoons cold water
1 tablespoon vodka
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon milk

Makes four empanadas.

Steps:
For the filling:

Add sliced shallots, salt, pepper and olive oil or butter to pan and sauté over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until the shallots are soft and translucent.

[img618 fullwidth]

Add the mushrooms and continue to sauté for additional five to 10 minutes, or until the mushrooms have browned and the shallots caramelized.
Take pan off heat. Add spinach and stir. The residual heat should cook the spinach enough so that it wilts down significantly.

[img619 fullwidth]

Add ricotta, mozzarella and nutmeg to a bowl. Remove grease from pan with a paper towel, and add the vegetable mixture to the cheese. Stir until well combined. Reserve.

For the pastry:

Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

Add flour and salt to a medium-sized bowl and whisk together. Add shortening or butter to bowl and cut in with a fork or pastry blender until the dough resembles the texture of coarse sand.

Add 1 tablespoon of water, and stir with a fork to combine. Add the vodka, and stir again to combine. Repeat with water, until the dough is moistened and can be formed into a ball.

Roll the dough into one big ball. Cut ball into quarters. Roll quarters into balls, and using a floured rolling pin, roll each ball out into circles, each about a quarter of an inch thick.

[img620 fullwidth]

Add 1 to 2 spoonfuls of filling to one half of the dough circles, being careful to leave about a half inch of space at the edges of the dough. Using a finger, dab the edges of the dough with a small amount of water to make the dough stick. Fold the dough over, creating a semicircle. Press the edges of the dough with a fork, or crimp as desired to ensure that the pastry doesn’t open up when cooking. Prick the center of the empanada with a fork to make holes for steam to escape when cooking.

[img622 fullwidth]

Whisk egg yolk and milk together to create an egg wash. Brush egg wash over each empanada.

Place empanadas on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is flaky and golden-brown.

Allow five minutes to cool before serving.

I shook my head, saying, “Iie, iie,” in reponse – the most direct translation of no.

“I’m sorry, I don’t speak Japanese,” I tried to explain.

“You are Chinese, then?” said one of the men.

“Yes and no. I suppose, but I’m American.”

“But you’re Chinese, yes?”

“Yes, but my parents are from the Philippines.” After a pause, they went back to preparing to carry the elaborate decorated floats, most likely confused by my response.

They wouldn’t be the first in that regard, but they were the first in Asia. As with so many other times in my life, people attempting to assign me an ethnicity – and by extension, a cultural identity – failed to grasp the reality of what it means to be an ethnically Chinese, American citizen by way of Southeast Asia, born and raised in the Los Angeles area. Say that five times fast.

For most conversational purposes, the easy answer to the somewhat pointed question of “What are you?” or more directly, “What is your ethnicity?” is that I am Chinese. However, I know little about Chinese culture beyond what textbooks and the internet have taught me. I also barely speak Chinese, aside from a few words courtesy of my parents’ ill-fated attempt to have me learn from a Mandarin tutor over two consecutive middle school summers.

Usually the interrogation ends there, a question mark left dangling for many, but not compelling enough to delve in further.

One might call me a stereotypical case of whitewashing – I am, after all, a person of color whose primary language is English and whose grasp of my family’s culture is tenuous at best. It’s a derogatory term, yes, but in many ways, it’s true – I was raised during a historical moment of supposed post-racial colorblindness without a firm grasp on a particular culture beyond the vast American one. In my definition, whitewashing is when a person of color is stripped of all background and culture, left empty and ready to be filled with the greater, white-centric U.S. culture, cast into the long-hailed American melting pot, to emerge an American through and through.

However, the reality is much more complicated than the typical case of American assimilation. The truth is that I am Chinese Filipino, a little-known minority in the Philippines. Yes, there are Chinese people in the Philippines – as there have been since the 16th century, when Manila became home to the world’s first Chinatown. My mother is part-Filipino: Her great-grandmother was a Filipino woman, a maid in China who carried on an illicit affair with her employer.

In the Philippines at least, Chinese people are a distinctive minority with a particular subculture, although a large portion of them marry other Filipinos. Both sets of my grandparents came to settle in the Philippines before World War II, and although family lore doesn’t delve into economic push-pull factors, the Communist Party’s tightening grip on the rural Fujian province likely had something to do with it.

If the asker of the question has a few minutes or seems somewhat interested, I might launch into a convoluted historical explanation of the Southeast Asian Chinese diaspora and how populations of ethnically Chinese people have blended into various Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. Members of this diaspora tend to come from the coastal Chinese province of Fujian and speak a dialect of Chinese similar to Taiwanese Hokkien.

My cultural identity is something of an enigma, neither here nor there in terms of Chinese and Filipino. My parents, despite both having been born and brought up in the Philippines before moving to the United States, retain a strong sense of Chinese identity even though they have never visited the country, and we don’t have any relatives we know of residing there. On the other hand, I frankly don’t feel Chinese, from not understanding Fujian, my parents’ common language, to not celebrating Lunar New Year. What one might recognize as Chinese food wasn’t something you could find in my family’s kitchen, and I only became acquainted with it, like most Angelenos, through the various notable restaurants of the San Gabriel Valley.

As a toddler, I’d mix up my B’s and V’s, and later landed in English as a second language classes after an administrative mix-up coupled with a slight but clearly discernible Filipino accent in kindergarten. I’d use words in English syntax like basura and calavera, loanwords from Spanish in my mother’s Filipino dialect of Visaya. Every summer as a child, I’d fly to visit my mother’s family in Cebu City, where we’d feast on lechon and balut. My distant Filipino relative, who acted as my nanny and grandmother figure, raised me as a God-fearing Catholic. My parents have Spanish names and in naming my sister and me, followed the Spanish-derived convention of keeping my mother’s maiden name as our middle names. But I could hardly call myself Filipino – and still can’t – either from an experiential perspective or a phenotypic one.

Nevertheless, I hoped halfheartedly that I’d find my cultural roots at UCLA, where my physical appearance lets me blend into the crowd. After all, Asian and Pacific Islander domestic students make up approximately a third of the undergraduate student population. But in my time here, I’ve little been able to relate to Samahang Pilipino or the Association of Chinese Americans – speaking neither Tagalog nor Mandarin, my experience is squarely somewhere else. I could count on one hand the number of other students I’ve met who are mixed Filipino and Chinese.

Among ethnically Chinese and Taiwanese friends and acquaintances I met during my first year, I found myself repeating over and over that my family didn’t celebrate Lunar New Year. My ethnicity, at introductory conversations at club meetings and parties, always came with an explanation. Over the past four years I’ve realized more than ever that I do not fit neatly carved out identities exemplified by cultural organizations such as Samahang Pilipino and the Association of Chinese Americans.

I’ve come to learn that my ethnic identity defies traditional confines, as much as it travels within them. My academic knowledge of Chinese culture substitutes nicely in conversations with Chinese- and Taiwanese-American friends. Among Southeast Asians, both domestic and international, I recognize my father’s “lah” when he speaks on the phone to his family members. I talk to Singaporean and Malaysian students and surprise them with my love of SkyFlakes and Milo. Visiting the Philippines again the summer after my first year at UCLA, I stuck out like a sore thumb, even among my mother’s family. That being said, I definitely am reminded, at times painfully, I still play the role of perpetual foreigner, like many Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, from the way people ask twice over, “Where are you from?” to the times I was called racial slurs in high school.
More than anything, I’ve realized I will always somewhat play the role of chameleon and that perhaps, for someone like me, there is no real niche to fit into. I am a product of the Southeast Asian Chinese diaspora, further displaced onto American soil. The pieces of my culture have been lost, transformed or merely molded into something entirely new. This is the quilt flag I stitch together, to wave in the air at people, whether abroad or here, to declare yes, this is my identity, a patchwork of information and experiences answering those usual questions: Where are you from? What are you? What do you identify as?

Sometimes I feel angry, frustrated at the lack of firm culture I can proudly call my own, wondering if in a few generations’ time my family’s culture, either Filipino or Chinese, will be long forgotten. If I have children, I hope to remind them that this complex origin story can be empowering, even if it’s rather convoluted. I relish my mouthful of words and explanations that do not fit neatly like other hyphenated Americans. I know as long as I hold on to the cultures I fall in between and remember these stories and moments, both historical and personal, I will not be dissolved into the greater homogeneity of the American melting pot and that I will not be, simply put, whitewashed.

139,15,Hike LA: Devil's Punchbowl,hike-la-devils-punchbowl,prime/spring-2017/lead/web.prime.hike.la.picD.OE.jpg,"","As I drive north on the 405 Freeway from UCLA, the Red Hot Chili Peppers sing to me through my radio. I pass Sherman Oaks, Panorama City and Mission Hills and keep driving. By San Fernando Valley, I continue on I-5 north and make my way onto the Antelope Valley Freeway, driving with the edge of the Angeles National Forest in my sight. I’m not in Los Angeles anymore. At least not conventional LA, where popular hikes lie minutes away from a Starbucks.

[img624 fullwidth]
I have hiked in Griffith Park many times, seen the Eaton Canyon waterfall in summer and winter, walked the shady trails of Will Rogers State Historic Park and strolled through the flowers of Topanga. Frankly, I’m bored with the conventional, regular scenes of the city that I’m used to. I’m looking for a new area that’s definitely out of the way.

Located in the north side of the Angeles National Forest, southeast of Palmdale, Devil’s Punchbowl looks nothing like a punch bowl. Its name comes from the nearby Punchbowl Fault, which created the formation. The eerie silence of the scenery, the mysterious rock formations that jut out like glass shards and the rocks' red-orange hues give a devilish, dark feeling to the area.

Starting the hike from the parking area, the trailhead offers a few options. On the right lies a 1.1 mile loop trail heading down into the “bowl” and back up to the parking lot. The left side offers a scenic walkway and various hiker-made trails where you can create your own adventure, scrambling and exploring the sandstone rocks.

I stepped to the left to discover what those before me had found and made my way to the rocks. I scrambled around with my camera on the small peaks, taking pictures and taking in the environment.

It’s a wild scene that, because it offers a Mars-like landscape, gives you a moment of freedom and isolation from the busy city. I let my eyes and body run free, as I carefully navigated the slopes and walked through boulders. I allowed myself time to explore and take pictures, but the complete isolation and quietness became a double-edged sword, so I decided to turn back.

[img625 fullwidth]

I then tried the trail to the right, starting on the 1.1 mile through the bowl. The actual “bowl” is a miniature canyon with a sandy trail and rocks all over. The landscape had much more vegetation, with a variety of trees and shrubs, compared to the barren rocks I was climbing earlier. I felt like I was passing through a shrunken national park, reminiscent of the Yosemite or Zion national parks. As I walked along the floor of the bowl, the giant sandstone rock slabs towered above me – a killer spot for rock climbing, with trees growing higher up on the slab. After a slow walk of photographing the sights and making friends with a mixed border collie and her owner, I headed out.

I emerged after a tiring summit and walked out to my car. I took another look back at the area. There was something mystifying and beautiful about this place that I’m not used to. It took me completely out of hectic Los Angeles and to somewhere peaceful.

Brimming with vibrant sunflowers, dark red roses and periwinkle hydrangeas, the California Flower Mall is one of several flower shopping destinations in the Los Angeles Flower District. Located inside a large warehouse, various vendors sell their floral fare from 4:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Saturday and 5 a.m. to noon Sundays.

Although many of the other flower shops in the district specialize in a certain type of flower – orchid and rose shops being some of the most frequented specialty stores – the California Flower Mall features a collection of 30 vendor stalls, which either market certain flowers or present a vast collection for customers to peruse. Some stores are lined with only gerberas in a multitude of colors like electrifying blue, bright green and sunny yellow. Others feature a plethora of options, selling sunflowers alongside irises and roses.

But behind the bouquets being showcased at each of the stands is a vendor arranging the buds, petals and leaves of the flowers to his or her taste. Each vendor spends the day receiving shipments of seasonal flowers, which they gather into wedding centerpieces or floral arrangements. Join prime as we explore the vendors’ stories at the California Flower Mall and the ever-blossoming flower industry.

[img600 fullwidth]

## Growers Direct
The first shop in the warehouse, Growers Direct Flowers Inc., has sunlight pouring through the windows onto the orchids and leafy stems hanging over the counter at which flower designer Sylvia Lozano crafts floral arrangements. Next to the flowers is a wooden table topped with a coffee machine for Lozano's meetings with potential clients. As a flower designer, Lozano works with customers to envision how arrangements can be used to set the scene for quinceaneras or weddings.

Because Growers Direct specializes in large events, Lozano’s job requires an eye for aesthetics along with a mind for logistics. Lozano claims it is the balance of the creative with the analytical that makes her job so satisfying.

“We try to see what vision (customers) have, and we try to make that happen with flowers,” Lozano said. “We have to plan matching colors and matching bases all under a budget, so we take a lot into consideration.”

Lozano mainly works on arranging floral designs for weddings. Since weddings are such important dates in people's lives, being involved in the planning process is an honor Lozano does not take lightly, she said.

“One time we had a bride who lost her father and wanted a specific flower that reminded her of him,” Lozano said. “Even though the flower was not in season, we got it for her, and she cried when she saw the bouquets.”

Working with momentous events like weddings and coming-of-age ceremonies can be challenging when clients have expectations that cannot be fulfilled. Lozano often has to remind clients to keep an alternate plan in case the flowers are out of season or unattainable at the time.

“I have personally delivered flowers out of season for a bride before, and I will go out of my way to make a client’s wish come true,” Lozano said. “But I am still working with nature, so we have to be realistic.”

Lozano also loves engaging with her customers to gain face-to-face interaction and make the flower-arranging process have more significance. Because she can see her client's emotions, Lozano is able to be more passionate about her job and come through for her customers, she said.

“I love talking to the brides to plan the flower arrangements,” Lozano said. “When I see their excitement before, I want to make flowers that make them feel the same way on their special day.”

## Vinny’s Wholesale Plants and Flowers

Vinny’s Wholesale Plants and Flowers is the second stall in the row of flower shops. With alluring bouquets in a kaleidoscope of colors placed next to pristine, white floral centerpieces for the wedding collection, the stall’s strategic contrasting of color schemes instantly drew my eye. We went up to the two vendors behind the stand to ask if I could converse with them, and they each smiled and warmly said yes before pointing at the other to indicate who would do the talking. I asked if the two were related, and they informed me they were husband and wife. Incidentally Jovana Vazquez, had met her husband Geraldo Rojas at another flower market in Anaheim, California.

“I got in the business through my husband,"" Vazquez said. “I met him at the flower market, and we really hit it off. As I fell in love with him, I fell in love with the flowers.”

Vazquez joined her husband’s family business of wholesale floral service. Vinny’s is a business run by four different family members with four different units, three stalls in Los Angeles and one in Anaheim. With two stalls inside the California Flower Market, family members are able to run the business alongside each other.

“We are definitely very family-oriented,” Vazquez said. “That is why I love being there during family events like weddings and funerals to offer flowers and services.”

Both Rojas and Vazquez enjoy the freedom of working for themselves and collaborating with family members for business decisions.

“I enjoy that I am self-employed and do not have to answer to a boss,” Rojas said. “Plus, I work with my hands and am not stuck in an office filling out papers.”

Hearing this statement, Vazquez enthusiastically nodded and expanded on her husband’s sentiment, citing creative freedom as the main appeal of her job.

“The best part of this job is the freedom, especially when it comes to creativity,” Vazquez said. “I work with different arrangements and create a range of arrangements for so many different people.”

## El Poblano Flowers

After browsing through the numerous vendor stalls in the California Flower Mall, we stumbled upon a shop with an appearance straight out of a mythic tale. Bathed in blue light with crystals hanging off a flower arch, El Poblano Flowers specializes in delivering grandeur to whatever event it works on, said Myrna Alba, the stall’s vendor.

When I asked Alba for a breakdown of the company’s best-selling products, she took us behind the crystal-beaded entrance and walked us through the whole inventory. The arrangement designs are made primarily by her husband, Angel Alba. El Poblano’s specialty is not in wholesale but in offering smaller, more unique arrangements for customers, Myrna Alba said.

The Albas became involved with the flower business eight years ago through family connections, but did not have the California Flower Mall stall until about a year ago when Angel Alba took over his late brother’s flower shop.

“He found this empty space and decided to jump on the opportunity ... to start making his own unique floral designs,” Myrna Alba said.

Diverging from the usual bouquets and wood basket centerpieces of the other stalls, El Poblano’s signature product is its topiary, featuring the trunk of a miniature grapevine with a bush of a dozen crimson roses pinned to the top.

In addition to the topiary, El Poblano has a host of other specialized pieces that incorporate foliage and flowers to create complex arrangements. For instance, several of the arrangements make use of unconventional accessories like tea leaves, Casablanca lilies or colorful heads of cabbage to create striking pieces.

Beyond offering a variety of unique floral arrangements, El Poblano places a large emphasis on party rentals. Since flower arrangements often go hand in hand with big life events, Myrna has options for renting out flower arches – like the beaded one that greets customers – and extravagant thrones for quinceaneras or weddings.

“We love offering other options to our customers beyond the flowers,” Myrna said. “It is a big day for them usually, and we want to offer them the best services we have.”

There were few things I hated more than family parties at my house.

I tripped over the dozens of shoes littered in the doorway on my way to the dining room, where the sounds of chatter and chopsticks clicking together echoed through the crowded kitchen.

The kitchen island brimmed with food – steaming fried rice, spring rolls, rice cakes, egg rolls – all ready to be eaten. As I stood there with my best friend, a bowl of food in my hands, an aunt and uncle turned around and told us that we looked like the number 10.
Her the tall ‘one,’ me the fat ‘zero’.

I put my bowl down and walked away. I was angry.

I’d yell at them to leave me alone and they would look at me smugly, satisfied that they had successfully goaded and baited me into lashing out. Everything I did was always scrutinized and every word I said was always twisted.

My mother would always scold me afterwards, even if she sympathized with me.

“You’re not supposed to treat the adults that way,” she said. “That’s hỗn. They’re family.”

But real families don’t orchestrate elaborate schemes that result in some of their members having nowhere to live and no money to support themselves.

***

When I was 3, I moved into that two-story house with my parents, sister, grandma and aunt. My aunt's husband and three kids joined us over the years.

It seemed like a mansion when I first walked up the brick steps. The blank walls and pristine carpets were a canvas to fill with memories and stories.
And I did, for 15 years – a mix of good and bad ones. The house was where we held weddings, where we celebrated Christmases and Lunar New Years and birthdays and where I eventually lost my entire family.

The fights and arguments between my parents and the rest of my family had been going on for decades – most of them centered around my sister and me.

“They should go to UCI like their cousin. UCI is the best of the best!”

“Why do they need tutoring, are they dumb?”

“Why are you wasting their time in Girl Scouts? It’s unnecessary.”

We ignored their criticisms of the way we were raised and did everything our parents wanted us to do. We respected them, went to temple and got accepted into UCLA.

I didn’t understand why all of that wasn’t good enough for our extended family, until my mom told me – we were too good and achieved more than our family had wanted us to achieve.

Blood may be thicker than water, but jealousy is stronger still – and it spread easily through our family. Everyone ridiculed my parents for their lack of education and their perceived inability to raise my sister and I.

My parents had put their own college dreams and goals on hold because of my family. Rather than focus on themselves, my mom and dad helped my mom’s aunts, uncles and younger brothers and sisters come to America after the Vietnam War – where they would be able to go to college and have families of their own.

But the family was critical instead of appreciative. Even with all their doubts and disdain, my parents would “win” nearly every competition. My sister and I were the second- and fifth-oldest, respectively, in our generation. Throughout our lives, we would consistently outpace our cousins closest to our ages. And nothing pissed people off more.

They believed my parents were beneath them, and my sister and I should stay there as well. The children of parents with no college education shouldn’t outperform kids raised by educated pharmacists, engineers or doctors.

It just wasn’t done.

But it did happen and the arguments mounted until my grandma, aunt, uncle and cousins moved away in 2013, without saying goodbye. I couldn’t walk into their old bedrooms without being overwhelmed with sadness. The closets where we played hide-and-seek were now empty, the furniture gone with only the silence remaining.

I hadn’t seen the house that empty since I moved in.

[img609 fullwidth]

***

“We’re moving,” my mom said. I had been sitting in my dorm room that November night, looking out the window, when my phone rang.

“When?”

“Now. We have a couple days to finish packing before they’re kicking us out.”

My family had just undersold the house without telling my parents, completely out of spite.

They posted the notice from their lawyer on the front door while my parents were at work to let them know they had to move out immediately. No money of the sale would be given to them – nothing to help me with college, my sister with medical school or my parents find a new home.

My parents were strong, though. They put their heads down and packed up 18 years worth of history in a week, found a temporary house with enough space for the four of us and went about their lives. They were stressed, but they didn’t show it. They had to be my rocks, and they were.
I got the call on a Monday and helped them move into their new home that weekend. When I saw that moving truck the next morning, I felt my stomach drop. I had thought I was ready to leave, but I wasn’t.

Our rented townhouse was modern and nice, but it didn’t feel right. There wasn’t that stain on the carpet where I spilled paint during a school project. It didn’t have our video games and DVDs cluttering the family room or the dishes from afternoons spent baking piling up in the sink.
The little touches made it better – the smells of my mom’s food filling the kitchen, my dad placing pictures of my sister and I on the shelves, the piano at which I spent countless hours practicing being wheeled in.

But I still felt empty.

I had just started college at UCLA and while visits back to Santa Ana would have been easy, I used any excuse I could to avoid going back to an empty house.

My mom knew and she didn’t push me to come home, visiting me in Westwood with my dad instead. But she did push me to go to my grandma’s new house to pay my respects.

Never mind that my grandma was complicit in my parents’ suffering – she stood by while my aunts and uncles belittled them, condoning their actions. My mom told me how my uncle had called her a greedy prostitute for wanting money from the house sale to care for me and my sister.
He did that while my grandmother was there, watching in silent approval.

When I’d see her, she’d act as if nothing had happened, she’d hug me and greet me as if she cared for me. And I would hug her and greet her as if I were happy to see her. She showed me her new room, gesturing toward the shelves that were filled with photographs of family events and her grandkids. My sister’s face and my face were nowhere to be seen.

It didn’t matter how much we cared for them or what we did for them. Like my parents, we were just as disposable and easily forgotten.
I didn’t trust them or like them, but you don’t cut off phone calls, text messages or visits with almost 40 people without consequence.
Instead of just being angry, loneliness entered the cycle.

[img608 fullwidth]

It alternated between crying myself to sleep while looking at family photos and sitting in the darkness at Janss Steps, frustrated because I felt like things were spiraling out of control.

The hopelessness took a toll on my body – bulimia, anorexia, anxiety, depression. I tried to hide them all. I didn’t want to seem weak. I didn’t want my problems to become anyone else’s. I didn’t want my parents to worry.

I wanted to be the daughter they raised – tough and resilient. Moving on, though, meant letting go. I couldn’t continue being angry at my family without letting it consume me. It also meant trusting people enough for them to fill the void.

I had always been introverted and cautious, but after my family’s betrayal, letting people in became even harder. I had my parents and my sister, but few others could breach my walls.

But they did. Slowly.

Heart-to-heart talks over wine and pizza rolls with my roommates, chatting with my bosses in between work and confiding in my friends on the toughest days pulled me out of my own dark thoughts. They became that family I craved, the people I could rely on.

***

The moving van was back months later, ready to load up that unpacked boxes and bring them to a new house.

A permanent one.

There was no feeling of dread, no despair and no anger this time. Just relief. A fresh start was a 20-minute drive away.

Walking up the driveway to this new house felt different. It was empty and a bit dusty, the kitchen in need of repair and the living room screaming for new paint.

My mom walked around animatedly pointing at all the different things she wanted to change once she saved up enough money – the tiles she would replace, where she would put the new oven, how she would knock out the divider and put in a kitchen island instead. I hadn’t seen her or my dad so relaxed in years.

And looking out the sunlit window, I couldn’t help but relax alongside them.

It was a home, and it was ours.

***

Whenever I start missing my old life, I stop by my childhood house – a quick drive by to see what it’s like now.

It doesn’t look the same anymore. I don’t feel the same longing or nostalgia. The things that happened there are faint echoes, no longer prominent stories.

I have nothing tying me down there, and I don’t have to stop. I just keep going.

Now, I go home.

Welcome to the last prime of the year! We’re nearing the end of spring, and graduation nostalgia is in the air. prime went out to see some of the best of Los Angeles, as well as hear stories from students we normally wouldn’t hear from.

This quarter’s City Guide takes you to the coast of Malibu, while Hike LA takes you inland to the San Gabriel Mountains. The infamous Paul Smith pink wall and other murals on the walls of Los Angeles are looked at in a different light. We tasted and decided on the best taco in the city – try it if you don’t believe us. Or you could always use our recipe for an excellent empanada. Exploring the beautiful Los Angeles Flower District piqued our interest in flower-pressing. There are also personal stories about conflicting cultures, cultural expectations and what makes up a home. We were given the opportunity to sit in a creative writing class comprised of student veterans. Their unforgiving wit and humor comes forth in their writing, offering us insight into their lives. 

With our last issue of the year, we’d like to thank you, our readers. It’s been a pleasure serving you as the 2016-2017 prime editorial staff.

Peace, love, prime,

Students and professors look to campus coffee shops for their daily dose of energy to make it up all the UCLA hills. Their minds are often on their mocha lattes and double espressos, but have they ever stopped to think what it’s like to be behind the counter? Join prime as we explore a day in the life of a student barista. 

---

## 6 a.m.

The sun has just begun to rise.

A little groggy, Michael Adia walks from his dorm to Kerckhoff Coffeehouse for his opening shift. He collects the cash for the day from Ackerman Union, switches on the cash registers and begins brewing the first batch of coffee. When the coffee shop opens at 7 a.m., Adia is immediately swamped with a line of customers that trails out the door.

“Coffee makes their world go round,” said Adia, a second-year civil engineering student.

Amid the morning rush, a man who works at Counseling and Psychological Services comes in, asking for his usual tall soy mocha. He specifies – as he does every morning – that his name is Bryan with a Y and asks for a receipt. Adia draws a smiley face on his cup.

Later, Adia and his co-workers greet another UCLA employee who frequents the cafe. Adia has already prepared his piping hot grande Italian coffee, with room.

“After you give it to him, he’ll always say, ‘Terrific!’” Adia said. “I remember one morning when I didn't see him and to me, that was odd because he’s been coming here longer than I’ve been working here.”

As the minutes go by, Adia hands out cup after cup to student after student. He said he dreams of becoming an 80-year-old barista at his very own coffee shop.

---

## 10 a.m.

Daniel Leventhal, wearing a baseball cap, ambles toward UCLA’s smallest coffee shop: Terasaki Cafe.

Leventhal, a fourth-year Portuguese student, is the only employee on shift. He prepares the usual tea bags and bagels at a coffee stand no bigger than a golf cart.

Students, researchers and even firefighters trickle into the courtyard throughout the morning and patiently wait for their coffee and pastries. Between customers, Leventhal finds some time to do his homework.

Among the usual crowd of students and professors, the UCLA mariachi band, Mariachi de Uclatlán, approaches Leventhal, asking for some coffee. 

Surprised by their arrival, he asks them to sing for him. They put on a show right there in the courtyard, the upbeat sounds of guitars and trumpets carrying into the nearby buildings.

And then it’s back to work.

“Terasaki never gets awfully busy,” he said. “But since I work alone, I have to make things happen by myself.”

After a couple of hours of brewing, waste water accumulates in the stand’s tank. Leventhal collects a pipe from the storeroom, attaches it to the receptacle and allows the liquid to drain out. The pipe leaks a little, and he quickly cleans it up to avoid a sticky floor and an angry building manager.

---

## Noon

Mariana Loza gathers up her books after studying at Young Research Library and rushes to change into her navy work polo and cap.

Loza, a fourth-year fine arts student, begins work nearby at Cafe 451, located on the first floor of the library. The cafe is named in honor of Ray Bradbury's famous novel ""Fahrenheit 451,"" which was written in UCLA's Powell Library.

“Most people are there in the afternoon to study or to meet,” Loza said. “The cafe is busy in a quieter sort of way because it’s in a library.”

Throughout the afternoon, Loza restocks snacks, throws out the old coffee and makes fresh hot and iced coffee – a schedule with little room for anything else.

But then a student worker tries to plug in a phone charger into one of the coffee shop outlets and it suddenly sparks up, creating a miniature fire. Loza and her coworker, in a state of panic, run to get the fire extinguisher from the room next door, rushing back just in time to put out the flames.
“The funny thing is the customers saw us freaking out, but they didn't react at all,” Loza said. “They just kept studying.”

## 3 p.m.

Students napping on the lawns of the Murphy Sculpture Garden in the lazy afternoon pick up some coffee to recharge themselves at the tiny and secluded cafe next door – Stage Canteen.

From behind her counter in MacGowan Hall’s courtyard, Hashwini Ganesh, a fourth-year economics student, watches people sing and recite film scripts. Occasionally, they break into a dance if their part involves choreography.

“People in the film school are always very loud, and I like it,” Ganesh said.

Ganesh’s favorite customer, a graduate student, comes in. She steams the milk and mixes powder into his tall chai latte.
“He always complains it’s hot in LA, yet he always gets a hot drink,” Ganesh said.

While designing some latte art in his drink, Ganesh and him have conversations about their countries of origin, their lives and sometimes the weather.

“We were just talking and we found out we have the same kind of heritage,” she said. “He’s Sri Lankan and I’m half Sri Lankan as well. I don’t know why it was interesting, but I just remember that moment all the time.”

Ganesh hands him his cup, waving goodbye as he leaves.

## 5 p.m.

Customers slowly start to drift away from Music Cafe and head back home as their need for coffee diminishes with the sun’s rays.

However, student barista Lauren Kean’s work shift has just begun. A fourth-year atmospheric, oceanic and environmental sciences student, Kean makes herself a quick cup of coffee to get through her closing shift at Music Cafe.

Five minutes after the cafe closes, a woman comes in and orders a decaffeinated coffee. Kean has already cleaned out the coffee tumblers, so she apologizes to the customer and explains the situation. The woman is persistent and approaches Kean again, hoping to change her mind. In order to appease the customer, Kean brews the decaffeinated coffee again and ends up staying overtime.

“I was annoyed at how demanding someone could be, and I still think of it from time to time,” Kean said. “I saw her at Barney’s (Beanery) in Westwood one time and ... all the feelings came back.”

Kean gets over the negative experiences at work by laughing about them with her co-workers.

“I usually remember the bad customers more than the good customers,” Kean said. “(But my co-workers and I) manage the stress of the day by drinking lots of coffee, eating pastries, complaining a lot and playing music.""

Los Angeles, I’m just trying to figure you out.

When I moved to Los Angeles for college, people told me this city has a different culture, even compared to other places on the West Coast. I’ve found that LA does have its own way of living life, full of quinoa, Lululemon and street murals.

Now, the brunch thing I can get behind. But in a culture of wall art selfies, I’m still grappling with the idea that our appreciation for artwork in Los Angeles has become reduced to how Instagrammable it is.

[img614 fullwidth]

You already know the most famous Los Angeles wall, the Paul Smith pink wall on Melrose Avenue. Paul Smith Los Angeles, a designer clothing store, opened in 2005 with its outer walls painted pink in order to attract people driving by. Now, it lures thirsty millennials who wait in line in a parking lot to use it as a photoshoot backdrop for a trendy Instagram post.

#Pinkwall has more than 48,000 tags on Instagram, and though not all of those are the Paul Smith wall, a good portion of them are.
This quarter, I drove to Melrose Avenue to check out the pink wall for the first time in my three years at UCLA. A security attendant had a booth in the Paul Smith parking lot and said no professional cameras were allowed.

On a sunny afternoon, tourists squinted in line, waiting for other people to finish their mini photoshoots because of the limited space against the wall. To get a little more creative, one woman reclined on the hood of her Jeep while a man snapped photos of her with the wall in the background.
Tourists and locals come, wait in line, immediately turn their backs on the art, put on an extra wide smile and then check their phone to evaluate the photos. It’s a desperate assembly line; everyone wants the photos of the art, but no one really looks at it. It’s analogous to looking and not seeing – photographing and not experiencing.

We’ve heard this all before, but Los Angeles seems more seeped in this culture. The “do it for the ’gram” slogan encourages me to make once-in-a-lifetime memories like skydiving or trying escargots, but also makes me feel like I’m ignoring my surroundings to capture an artificial moment for the sake of participating in a social media trend.

During fall quarter, Carly Pierson was driving down Melrose Avenue to get her computer fixed when she and her dad passed by the pink wall.

“That’s the famous wall!” she said to her dad.

They dropped off her computer and decided to go take pictures.

“He’s, like, super LA,” Pierson told me. “He knew about it, too.”

Pierson was wearing pajamas at first but she had some laundry in the car, so the third-year microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics student changed outfits.

Using an iPhone, Pierson’s dad took photos of her and they took selfies together. As a photographer, her dad was excited for the backdrop and helped Pierson prep her hair.

Pierson put her leg on the wall for some imaginative shots, but she said the parking lot guards yelled at her to stop. She ended up posting a semi-candid photo on her Instagram.

Pierson said the wall is a popular tourist destination for her out-of-state and international friends, and murals are also popular for their impact on social media.

“When I’m scrolling through Instagram, I’ll notice those pink walls,” she said. “Those are the ones that will catch my attention.”

Growing up in Thousand Oaks, California, she said mural art wasn’t as trendy as it is now that she attends UCLA. She has made friends from Wisconsin, Texas and Connecticut, and they like traveling to Abbot Kinney Boulevard for the murals. They take a new picture and post it on Instagram, but they also make a day out of the trip to Venice, she said.

“It’s a weird thing to think about that in earlier times, before social media, the only people who would do that would be photographers,” Pierson said.
Jayne Skinner posted a photo of the pink wall on Facebook as her profile picture. The fourth-year psychobiology student traveled to the mural earlier this year with the cast of “Waitress in Concert,” a show put on by Positivity Productions on campus in March.

“It was originally taken for the show, but I thought it was a good picture and it’s fun to have the pink wall as your profile picture, so I just kept it up after,” she said.

The performers elected to go early one morning to avoid crowds and have enough wall space to themselves for the photoshoot.

Skinner said they chose the backdrop because it is an iconic LA location. The UCLA students wanted to use it for posters and social media advertisement for their musical about a waitress in a southern town who becomes pregnant unexpectedly.

“It’s very bright and vibrant, so it’s obviously an ideal place to take pictures,” she said. “But I also think that it’s become a landmark in its own right. It’s not just because the wall is pink – it’s because it’s 'The Pink Wall.'""

After snapping selfies in front of the Melrose pink wall, my friend and I crossed the street to Carrera Cafe, which also has a wall mural on the side of its building. The painting has changed from lip prints, to the “La La Land” purple backdrop, to Lady Gaga’s Coachella logo. I went during Coachella season and was greeted by a black-and-white portrait of Lady Gaga surrounded by blue sky and purple palm trees with “Coachella” blazoned across her face.

My friend and I snapped some photos there, which I later posted on my own Instagram account. The outdoor cafe tables were pushed out of the way to create an optimal photo op.

One woman leaned against the Coachella mural wearing a lace shirt, beige pants, sandals, sunglasses and red lipstick. She flipped her hair back in the bright sun.

We went inside the glass cafe and people-watched for an hour. Customers came in wearing trench coats, denim dresses, backpack purses, big sunglasses, pink shirts, studded boots, beige blazers and Converse sneakers.

“It’s such a type of people that come,” my friend whispered to me.

Half of the people in the cafe could have been Abercrombie models with their Levi’s jackets, gold chokers and blue-and-white striped blouses.
People came in and out of the coffee shop, which had black and white tiled floors and little succulents on white tables. The words “Ciao Bella” were lit up in white on the cafe wall.

We had a view across the street of people posing like “Charlie’s Angels” against the pink wall.

People continued to wait in line to take pictures with the walls, but no one stood to really look at the art. It’s all just for digital display. The paintings aren’t meant to be seen with eyes, but through a screen.

Inside Carrera Cafe, a teenage girl stood above a table with her rose gold iPhone and snapped overhead photos of four lattes with foam artwork that included a flamingo and the word “hello.”

Another young woman handed her phone to her friend; her camera roll was open so the friend could look through photos to pick the most Instagram-worthy one.

Meanwhile, a middle-aged woman silently read the newspaper with her cup of coffee in the corner. Everyone else had some cucumber Chobani whatever drink, vinaigrette salad or iced coffee, their cameras snapping away.

“The coffee’s not that good,” I said.

“That’s not why people come,” my friend laughed.

Most perplexing were two teenage girls with a pink polaroid and a blue clutch wallet; they rotated tables inside the cafe looking for the best lighting and poses. A woman – likely their mother – came with them as if chaperoning an exciting school field trip.

“The lighting is so good!” “Oh I love that!” “That’s so cute!” “Thank you so much,” they giggled to each other.

The ice was melting in their cinnamon-topped lattes. But that’s not why people come.

Sure it’s fun to be ""bougie"" and take pink wall photos and drink coffee next to succulents, but I always feel like I’m faking it. I’m running through the motions of participating in this LA culture, but I never feel like I’m the originator – always the emulator.

Is there a real originator of LA culture? Does anyone do it solely for the pleasure or is everyone doing it to mimic other photos they’ve seen?

It’s a trend or a fad in the most reductive sense. It’s an item to check off a list. We drive to go see a pink wall in order to get the photos to prove we did it.

A mural on the UCLA Extension building is trying to send a bigger message than a shallow Instagram post.

On Le Conte Avenue in Westwood, Los Angeles artist Colette Miller added a pair of purple wings to the building facade in November. UCLA Extension officials asked Miller to paint the wings to inspire students to have a passion for lifelong learning.

Miller studied film at UCLA Extension in 2000 and began the Global Angel Wings Project in Los Angeles in 2012 to remind people that humans are angels on Earth. She estimates she has painted more than 100 angel wings around the world in places such as France, Cuba, Kenya, New York City and Washington, D.C.

“I thought if you were in some dark alley or some crossroads in your decision and your consciousness, wouldn’t you like to be reminded of the goodness in humanity?” Miller said. “And that’s where the wings technically birthed.""

When she painted her first pair of wings in downtown LA, she didn’t even have an Instagram. She didn’t always sign the murals. The intention was to give the world a reminder of mankind’s angelic qualities. Now, Miller said sharing the photos on social media enhances the message, since it spreads the meaning across the internet.

“It came from a really sincere place, really pure and childlike, ... of putting this image out there that I feel is really a divinity,” she said. “But I wasn’t trying to be hashtags.”

Miller avoids putting hashtags on her paintings because they clutter the image, turning it into an advertisement and detracting from the pure message of the artwork. Sometimes plaques next to the wings will describe the Global Angel Wings Project, sponsorships and hashtags, she said. #Colettemiller has about 12,000 tags on Instagram.

Sometimes Miller travels to the locations and sometimes she ships the artwork to its destination, like her with upcoming Tokyo piece. She added a pair of wings to the Chicago airport, and since the wall was after the security checkpoint, she had to be escorted by security guards with her tools and knives to the location.

Each pair has slightly different textures, colors and shapes, similar to how no two people are identical, she said. Miller gets lost in the work.
For Miller, the wings represent a positive message of peace and divinity, but I noticed that they also demonstrate the principle of using fine art to post photos online.

Social media users make digital copies of Los Angeles murals and post them on the internet for mass consumption. Perhaps this is the new way art is appreciated, more so than in museums. But I wonder if this is fully consuming and digesting a piece of art – unwrapping it and letting it sit on your tongue before swallowing.

Our culture is viral – akin to a disease.

“Is it even adding to your life?” my friend asked me about the pink wall. “You put it on social media, and then what?”

It’s entertaining to visit the famous walls of Los Angeles, but putting it on my social media should not be fulfilling. It’s hollow unless I truly appreciate the artist’s meaning, like the angel wings symbolizing divinity.

Our lifestyle is about constructing false memories that never existed because we were too busy trying to capture them. LA culture only exists online, but I want to live in the real world.

""Why did you join?""

""Thank you for your service.""

Student veterans usually react with a shoulder shrug, a brief, “Oh you know, for the money,” or an awkward “You’re welcome.”

Instead of owning their military service, some choose not to identify as veterans or to downplay this significant aspect of their identities.

But in a bright room on the second floor of the Humanities Building, student veterans freely discuss the soaring highs and devastating lows of serving in the military and the stigma they face outside the classroom. Nine men and one woman, seven ex-Marines and three ex-Army make up English Composition M138: ""Writing Military Experience,"" a creative writing course taught by professor Reed Wilson, exclusively open to student veterans.

Among the group are students who have known extreme poverty, drug abuse, alcoholism, eating disorders, mental illnesses and post-traumatic stress disorder. The banter in the room is acerbic, with cutting jokes and put-downs flying back and forth.

“There’s one guy that’s not here that I openly beat on in each of my papers,” one student said jokingly, causing a ripple of knowing laughter from the others.

But beneath the fooling around is a bedrock of respect, honesty and shared experiences. Almost all the veterans present have been deployed to fight in various conflicts, mostly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and many of them have struggled to adapt to civilian life after they “got out.”

UCLA has more than 100 student veterans, and the community keeps a low profile. If they identify themselves as veterans, people’s perception of them is immediately warped.

After leaving the military, many wanted to steer clear of other veterans and the memories associated with their time on deployment. But this class offers a different opportunity for each them: a chance to be open and express past experiences they have left unexplored or buried deep in their subconsciousness.

Each week, the veterans take turns reading out their story, poem or other piece of creative writing.
Some weeks the stories come easily, some weeks they don’t. Some weeks the memories flow through the keys and onto the screen, some weeks they don’t.

""I Changed My Family Cycle"" by Colt Gordon

*I come from an interesting background. Ironically it was somewhat of a war zone. My dad was a full-time violent alcoholic and a part time construction worker. My mom suffered from chronic PTSD from her pedophile of a stepfather who molested her and her sisters repeatedly. Getting smacked around was good for me in some ways as I learned to mind, but for my mom it was hell. She was thrown through a glass shower door by my dad once; and I can still hear her blood curdling screams.*

Colt Gordon promised his grandma he would never get any tattoos. Given that his father was a tattoo artist and he was surrounded with body art during his time in the military, it was a serious promise to make.

For a six-year period of his life, Gordon fought an eating disorder and suicidal ideations. One day while on deployment in Iraq, Gordon thought he was going to die by his own hands. That same day he promised a friend he would seek help.

“I had a gun all the time, so I was always thinking how it would be easier if I was gone,” Gordon said. “But I had a friend who was always there for me, and he was the guy that said, ‘You never really opened up to me, but I care about you and I want you to promise me you’ll get help.’ I’m kinda juvenile in the sense that I always keep my promises.”

He said he wouldn’t be here today if he hadn’t kept that promise. Gordon is a third-year psychology student who was recently elected as the next president of the UCLA Student Veterans of America.

Writing about his experiences and reading his own writing aloud usually provides a dose of calm and catharsis for Gordon.

But when it came to composing for English Composition M138, he found himself hesitating and worrying about what everyone else would think.
“I’m naturally more of a guy that would have a cup of tea with the ladies, to be honest. It’s a weird thing about me,” Gordon said. “I can be very expressive and outward-going with women, but I didn’t have the inclination to hang out with the guys, shoot shit and talk about guns, but recently I’ve started embracing it and having more male friends.”

In his piece “I Changed My Family Cycle,” which deals with the complex decision of why he joined the Marines, Gordon reveals he came from a background of mental, physical and alcoholic abuse. While his father “died by the bottle at 49,” and his brother is currently serving 10 years in prison for grand arson, Gordon has forged himself a different path.

He joined the military to escape his situation, not serve his country out of some great sense of patriotism, he said.

Without the military, Gordon wouldn’t have overcome his depression or become dedicated to helping others with mental illness. Without the military, Gordon probably wouldn’t be alive.

“I’m almost 30, so some people could say that I’m late, I’m far behind, but there’s no way I would have gotten here without the military, there’s no way I would have turned my life around without the military,” Gordon said. “I have so many positive things to say about my time in the Marine Corps, even though it was hell.”

*While the Marine Corps may have accelerated my pain it also increased my willingness to seek the inevitable help I needed. What took four years to bring me to my knees to get psychological help might have never happened out in the civilian world. When I got treatment I realized I was not weak. In fact, I was strong for what I had endured over my life. I simply needed tools to get better and to get my life back.*

""Strip Club Veteran"" by Camilo Rocha

*Strip club veteran was this soldier’s name,
Chugging cans of redbull as his personal cocaine,
“Let’s go to Red Parrot!” he would exuberantly proclaim,
Strip club veteran, he would put any man to shame.
Camilo Rocha doesn’t like to be underestimated.*

When a UCLA recruiter came to Pasadena City College where he was at school, Rocha approached her and asked about transferring to Westwood. She asked for his GPA; he replied it was 3.28. The recruiter smirked and told him he needn’t bother applying. I’ll show her, he thought.

Rocha hunkered down, achieved straight A’s the next two semesters and transferred to UCLA as a psychology student.

“When people say I can’t do something, it drives me, when people underestimate me, it drives me. That’s a big motivator in life, trying to prove people wrong,” Rocha said.

Rocha’s parents both dropped out of middle school, and he describes the rest of his family as “drunks working in the fields.” In high school he was a self-confessed “alcoholic, pothead, hot-boxing teenager with a wild Afro and no prospects.”

He worked at In-N-Out Burger for two years, waiting to get his high school diploma. While at work one day, Rocha observed an overweight, burger-flipping colleague with sweat dripping down his forehead. Rocha came to a terrifying realization: That could be him in 30 years.

He had to do something drastic to escape the cycle of poverty his family was stuck in.

“Joining the military was a means to an end,” Rocha said. “The alternative was being a pot dealer who smoked his own stash. ... Within a month of stepping into the recruitment office I was gone.”

Seven years in the military brought many highs, lows and everything in between for Rocha, during which he met people from all walks and in all phases of life.

One of professor Wilson’s prompts was to recount an interaction with another member of the armed forces, and Rocha wrote about a “strip club veteran” who parties every night and asks his friends to spot him a “couple 20s,” before slinking home to his wife at night.
“I wanted the people to think this character’s a massive douchebag; he’s thrown away his cash on strippers instead of paying attention to his wife,” Rocha said.

When he read his poem aloud in class, his fellow veterans laughed at the “strip club veteran’s” exploits and were eager to know who he was based on. To their amazement, Rocha revealed the “strip club veteran” was based on a 20-year-old version of himself.

Writing the poem helped Rocha reflect on the person he used to be before he quit drinking and gave him perspective on how far he had come from his alcohol- and drug-fueled days.

“To be the first to be here at UCLA, for myself and my son, it’s going to change the rest of our family lineage,” Rocha said. “You know, you can come from the shittiest background possible, be in the worst situation, but if you put in the effort, fight the odds, you can be a success too.”

With a face full of glitter and reeking of booze,
He sneaks back home while his wife takes a snooze,
“Hun is that you? It’s late where you been?”
“Just taking care of ARMY stuff” he says with a grin.

*Strip club veteran, he’s survived another tour,
Bank account now empty and still immature.*

""Survivalist"" by Timothy Perkins

*When 6’6” Staff Sergeant Matrix Elias showed up at my door in dress blues, I knew I was signing with the Marine Corps and I wouldn’t take no for an answer. There were lots of reasons I was impressed with the Marine Corps, for one they came to me in dress blues and seemed to pay zero attention to the shit hole I lived in. It feels good to feel wanted, and that right there was probably enough to get me to sign. Also I felt like I had found a community. My friends, as loyal as they were and continue to be, never came to my house. SSGT Elias showed up in dress uniform and accepted me right where I was at.*

In winter quarter, Tim Perkins raised his hand to make a comment in a class. After a brief, perfectly mundane back-and-forth with the professor, Perkins found he was breaking out into a heavy cold sweat.

Perkins said he has grown largely accustomed to dealing with normal classroom situations since he left the military in 2008, but it took him several years to get used to participating in group interactions. The military conditioned him to be hyperaware of his surroundings, and he said he still finds himself subconsciously watching everyone’s hands and movements.

“It was a physiological reaction to feeling really uncomfortable in a public environment,” Perkins said. “I haven’t had a reaction like that in a while, but it still pops up from time to time.”

After leaving the Marine Corps, Perkins spent five years going to one-on-one therapy sessions to help figure out “what the hell was going on” in his brain. At the time, he wasn’t sleeping and was having regular panic attacks. His coping methods of choice were drinking heavily and smoking copious quantities of marijuana.

When he returned from his final tour, Perkins said he was shocked by how little people understood the emotional cost of sending people to war, and many people he spoke to expressed hard-line opinions doubting whether he should have been in Afghanistan in the first place.

“I remember I got back in 2008 at the height of the election, and I remember coming back and thinking, 'Jesus, this country hates itself,'” Perkins said. “It was the most unwelcome welcome home you could possibly imagine.”

Five years of therapy with a fellow ex-Marine helped Perkins acclimatize, and things started to click in his life and his mind. He found a job through another veteran, started getting straight A’s at his community college and decided he wanted to give four-year college a shot.

While Perkins said not every veteran in the class has been through a similar course of therapy, he believes English Composition M138 provides a vehicle for each of them to express their emotions and dredge up memories from their subconsciousness.

“We’re not a community that’s well known for being able to tell our story. The military is very masculine-dominated, full of toxic masculinity,” Perkins said. “It’s this inability to share your emotions or understand your own emotions, so the class is a great opportunity to sit down and dig into yourself.”
In his “Survivalist” story, Perkins attempted to untangle the “knot of emotions and life events” that led him to join the Marines. One of his driving motivations was to impress a girl, Monika, who came from a far wealthier family and whose parents looked down their noses at him from the moment he set foot in their house.

Perkins said he found it difficult at first to share the story, but that ultimately, none of the student veterans in the class or at UCLA had reached this point without a willingness to step out of their comfort zones.

“A lot of veterans lock themselves up inside their homes, but this is a different group of people because we’re willing to make a fool of ourselves,” Perkins said. “We’re here to get the most out of our experience here, just like everyone else is.”

*In the end Monika and I did end up dating after I got back from my second deployment. I even stayed with her at her parents house where we did things that probably broke their waspy hearts. After I left they called me a survivalist which is pretty astute coming from a couple of elitists. I broke up with Monika before my third deployment, I had gotten what I wanted from her and didn’t need her anymore.*

""Why I Joined the Marine Corps"" by Michael Williamson

*It’s hard to pinpoint one reason why I joined the Marine Corps, but maybe it was the travel, or maybe the adventure, or maybe just maybe it was actually for the money. I can’t truly know this answer unless I take a trip down memory lane, sounds lame, I know, but writing forces me to try to understand myself then and what was going through my mind at the time. I was 20 years old, going into my third year of community college, and was suckered into believing one day I would be a famous actor.*

Michael Williamson wanted to be a combat camera when he joined the Marine Corps.

He was anxious to leave behind his stagnant, “stoner” life for combat journalism school in Pensacola, Florida, where he would learn the film and journalistic techniques that would prepare him to enter combat holding a camera instead of a gun.

Everything was going to plan with military precision until, during an interview with the recruiter, he accidentally let slip he smoked pot on a regular basis.

“They gave me a drug waiver, and my boot camp day was changed,” Williamson said. “I had to change my job. I went down a spiral of disappointment.”

After his combat camera dreams were dashed, Williamson spent four years as a field artilleryman. He said his service made him a better person and allowed him to meet people from all types of backgrounds.

Some join the military coming from a wealthy, bourgeois background, desperate for an arena in which to prove themselves, while other recruits are “straight off the street,” Williamson said. For the latter, the military is often a drastic resort to make ends meet.

Williamson, a fourth-year world arts and cultures student, said the faces of his fellow Marines are clear in his memory, but their words are often lost. Writing helps him reclaim the experiences that are shrouded in his mind.

“It’s a process of digging into memory, which is sometimes hard,” Williamson said. “I don’t know if this is attributed to PTSD or trauma, but there’s a lot of fog in my memory. There are things I know that I experienced, but I can’t recall the narrative or the dialogue from those moments.”
With graduation coming up, Williamson has applied to be a probation officer working with incarcerated youth, but in the back of his mind he still feels a nagging desire to “go back in” and commit to a full career in the military as an officer. The camaraderie and brotherhood he found in the Marine Corps is hard to resist.

“You hear a lot of people talk about independence and we strive so hard to claim it, but when you are removed from those supporting structures and you don’t have someone to lean on, your life crumbles down,” Williamson said. “When you have a role within a social structure, you’re able to not only contribute to yourself but also to others.”

I am the first out of my immediate family to join the Marines; I am the first out of my immediate family to go to university; and proudly, I am the first out of my immediate family to not get a girl pregnant out of wedlock or OD on heroin. Yea, I guess you can say I come from a place of abuse, dysfunction and a lot of divorce, but hey the Marine Corps is full of that too and for the first time I actually felt like I found something that I had been missing for my whole life … FAMILY.

""That Fuckin’ Motorcycle"" by Donald Stiles

*The catalyst for my desire to join the Marine Corps came from the fact that I wanted to buy the YZF-Yamaha R1 motorcycle. I was at Chaparral motorsports with my best friend, Chris, who had just enlisted into the DEP for Marines. When he first told everyone that he was joining the Marine Corps, we all just said something like, “have fun with that,” or, in my instance, “see ya in four years, buddy.”*

Donny Stiles has a love-hate relationship with the military.

The love began at the age of 18 when he attended a combat arms exercise and witnessed a mine-clearing line charge blast a clear lane through a notional minefield. The hate part came from having to leave behind his Marine Corps brothers and the life-threatening experiences they endured together.

“When you get back, it’s a mundane life – there’s not as much excitement,” Stiles said. “You know, getting blown up lets you know you’re alive. You never appreciate life so much until you’ve survived that stuff.”

Stiles has written each of his English Composition M138 stories in 10 minutes flat, except for one. Partly because he’s writing about a subject he loves, and partly because sometimes he forgets and scrambles to get the story ready before rushing to class.

When Wilson gave the prompt to write about someone he met in the military, Stiles immediately thought of Jon, the best buddy he made while on tour in Iraq.

“At first I hated the guy,” Stiles said. “We got into an argument about leadership, and he thought as a sergeant he had the right to beat the shit out of his Marines if they didn’t accomplish a task, and I would never do that at all. I thought that it was the respect you earned that made people follow you.”

However, the two of them quickly became friends, moving in together when they “got out.”

They took care of each other, and when Jon started having suicidal thoughts, Stiles was there for him. Jon seemed like he was doing OK.
“I saw him the day before, and he looked fine, I didn’t see it coming. The shitty thing is that he died in the shower of our apartment in San Diego,” Stiles said.

It wasn’t as if he had never seen someone die before; in fact, Stiles said he prides himself on his ability to compartmentalize. His time in the Marines taught him to become numb to people dying, or at least not to focus or dwell on it.

But with his friend it was different.

“Seeing him dead and calling his mom to tell her was the hardest thing I had done in my life. The official autopsy report said acute ethanol intoxication. My buddy drank himself to death,” Stiles said. “I felt partly responsible because he moved out to California because of me. We were helping each other out, I was having a rough time too, and I failed him. He wouldn’t have died in California if it wasn’t for me.”

Although he couldn’t bring himself to finish his story on Jon, Stiles said he has “made his peace” with the loss of his friend.

As a fifth-year philosophy student and the vice president of the UCLA Student Veterans of America, Stiles now serves as an ambassador for his community.

He recently gave the keynote speech at a scholarship fundraising event, and he said opening up on stage helped others in the community come forward to talk about their experiences. English Composition M138 offers a similar opportunity for the 10 veterans present.

“One of the greatest things about this class is listening to other people’s stories,” Stiles said. “There’s a lot of morbid humor, but that’s just a coping mechanism. I think that letting fear affect you reduces your effectiveness, both in the military and as a person.”

*I never regretted my decision to join the Marine Corps. No matter how shitty and miserable I was in a specific moment; it was the best decision of my life. But, if I want to be completely honest with myself, I joined for two reasons. One, my shithead best friend chose the Marine Corps for some ungodly reason. Two, I rrrreeeeaaallly fuckin’ wanted that motorcycle.*

131,15,Taco the Town,taco-town,prime/spring-2017/lead/Tacos_5.jpg,"","Los Angeles is blessed with some of the hottest and spiciest taco joints in the nation. But with a plethora of options, it can be a bit overwhelming to decide where to go. To make your lives a little easier, I picked out four of the most flavor-packed taco joints that are accessible to UCLA students. At each stop on my trip, I ordered the most popular item on the menu to crown the righteous Rey de Tacos.

[img638 fullwidth]

## (4) Tacos Tu Madre

1945 1/2 Westwood Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90025

Korean BBQ taco: $3.75

Tacos Tu Madre is a small joint about 2 miles away from UCLA. It offers a variety of choices, many of which are unconventional, such as fried chicken tacos and Korean BBQ tacos. As a Korean, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Korean BBQ was one of its most popular choices. After getting the taco, I was thrilled – it was one of the most beautifully presented dishes I had ever seen. The red peppers were carefully placed around the kimchi and beef, and the streaks of green from cilantro and avocado looked like a flower garden. This best-selling taco cost a hefty $3.75, so I expected to get the best taco in town. Though the portion was rather small, it looked worth it. Disappointingly, however, what I tasted was subpar – overcooked meat coated in sweet-and-sour sauce. The not-so-soft shell was not the quality I was expecting from one of the most expensive tacos I had ever purchased. Although the different ingredients complemented each other well, it did not possess the ""wow"" factor I was looking for in order for it to be crowned Rey de Tacos.

[img642 fullwidth]

## (3) Leo’s Tacos Truck

1515 S La Brea Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90019

Al pastor: $1.25

Leo’s Tacos Truck is the place to go for the ultimate street taco experience. If you visit at night, a spit grill dressed with fresh roasted al pastor – spit-grilled meat – will greet you outside the truck. A salsa bar was set up where I could customize my tacos with any of the add-ons, such as diced onions, radishes and habanero peppers. Each taco is $1.25, but the portions are pretty small, so I ordered multiple al pastor tacos – their signature item. 

[img643 fullwidth]

Although the cheap store-bought quality of the ingredients – pretty much everything besides the al pastor – was not quite up to the standards set by other eateries I’ve visited, the tacos were well worth the money. Just thinking about the juicy al pastor paired with chunks of fresh pineapple makes me want to wait in line again for a couple more. The best part about Leo’s Tacos Truck was its customizability. I was able to load up on habanero peppers and diced onions to make one of the best tacos I’ve ever had. Although there is always a line and little space to eat, if you are a taco fan, Leo’s Tacos Truck is a must-try on your bucket list.

[img636 fullwidth]

## (2) Pinches Tacos

1030 Glendon Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90024

Asada: $3.50

Located next to Westwood’s Trader Joe’s, Pinches Tacos is a taco paradise right under our noses. The restaurant is decorated with Spanish graffiti, adding a bit of a lively flair. Although Pinches Tacos boasts handpicked ingredients and homemade tortillas, the tacos were a little pricey – mostly $3 to $4 each. I ordered the asada tacos by the restaurant’s recommendation. 

[img637 fullwidth]

At first, I was skeptical as to whether it would be worth the splurge for two – maybe three – bites. But as soon as I had a taste, I was more than convinced that Pinches Tacos was the real deal. Contrary to the common firm and chewy beef in a typical asada taco, the Angus beef was tender and easy on my teeth. Plus, it came complete with tomatillo salsa, onions and cilantro, providing the kick needed to enhance the juicy meat. Within walking distance from UCLA’s campus, Pinches Tacos is a close runner-up in this competition for the very best.

[img641 fullwidth]

## (1) Guisados

8935 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, CA 90069

Cochinita pibil: $2.75, spicy level 5

Guisados is a 15-minute car ride away from UCLA. When my friends highly recommended I try this place, I was unsure whether it would be worth the drive. Bottom line, up front, it’s a firm yes. In contrast to other taco joints, the hipster restaurant gives off a distinctly modern aura, with its brick walls and metallic furniture. Local art was on display in the “featured artist” section for the customers to admire while enjoying their food. 

[img640 fullwidth]

Every taco on the menu was $2.75; I ordered a cochinita pibil with a spice level of five out of 10, upon the cashier’s recommendation. At first the taco looked like a blob of saucy meat, but I mean, who eats a taco for its looks? The tender pork with an added crunch from the pickled onion, along with the sweet salsa and black beans, melted in my mouth. All I could think was, “This is one good taco.” Guisados was easily the best taco joint on this trip, and I will be returning soon with my buddies. Despite its distance from UCLA, Guisados is rightfully crowned Rey de Tacos.

138,15,DIY: Flower Pressing,diy-flower-pressing,prime/spring-2017/lead/web.prime.diy.flowerpressing.MRK.picA.jpg,"","The city of Los Angeles is in full bloom – a super bloom, in fact. All of the winter storms and showers have brought about an eruption of spring flowers. Southern California hillsides are painted with a variety of wildflowers – yellow, orange and purple – that have struggled through years of drought.

Unfortunately, my tiny apartment in Westwood boasts views of cement sidewalks rather than lush hillsides, so I’ve taken to purchasing bouquets from Trader Joe’s to evoke a little bit of that wild spring feeling. However, as the weather turns warmer the wildflowers are beginning to dry up and disappear, just as my tabletop flower arrangements start to wilt after only a few days. One simple remedy to make spring last longer, however, is flower pressing.

Flower pressing is a process that completely dries out the plant’s petals and leaves by flattening it. The flower is then preserved in a two dimensional form that won’t wither or decay. Overall, it’s a simple process that requires few materials and results in a charming decoration for your home. It’s ideal for making keepsakes out of flowers from your graduation, your secret admirer, or like us at prime, preserving spring.

[img631 fullwidth]

## Materials
Flowers

Plain paper or flat cardboard

Multiple books or heavy objects

Picture frame

Glue

## Instructions

Choose your flowers. Smaller, less bulky flowers will likely press more uniformly. 

Place the flowers between two pieces of paper – for this example, we used flat pieces of cardboard. This will help absorb moisture from the flowers while they are being pressed.

[img632 fullwidth]

Place the flowers inside a book. If you are using thin papers, choose a book you don’t mind leaving imprints on – ""The Complete Works of Shakespeare"" was my pick. Then place the book in a safe, dry location, and stack more books or heavy objects on top. This provides an excellent chance to make use of textbooks you’ve neglected to sell back.

[img633 fullwidth]

Wait two to three weeks – patience is indeed a virtue.

[img634 fullwidth]

Carefully open the book and remove the flowers, keeping in mind that they are very delicate. If desired, gently glue the flowers to a piece of paper and then place into a frame.

[img63

Hang the frame on your wall and enjoy springtime, even when it’s long gone.

141,15,prime City Guide: Malibu,prime-city-guide-malibu,prime/spring-2017/lead/web.prime.malibu.picE.MRK.jpg,"","It was a beautiful Saturday morning – the sun shone softly, the Santa Ana winds blew through the pair of palm trees in front of our apartment. We packed the trunk of my roommate’s car with water bottles, beach towels, swimsuits and snacks and lathered ourselves in sunscreen. Driving west along the Pacific Coast Highway, ocean waves crash to our left and yellow mustard plants decorated the Santa Monica Mountains to our right.

Malibu, with a total population of less than 13,000, is a relatively small community in Los Angeles County that offers the best of land and sea. While it is primarily known as a beach city – Zuma and Point Dume are two of its most popular beaches – and a desirable locale for scouting celebrity real estate, there are also plenty of opportunities for hiking and indulging your seafood cravings. Follow prime’s Malibu exploration for a taste of that coastal California lifestyle.

---

## Corral Canyon Loop

[img644 fullwidth]

For our first stop, we pulled into the parking lot of the Corral Canyon Loop, a trail just off the PCH. Our plan was to start our day with a short hike before gorging on lunch at Malibu Seafood, conveniently located less than 100 yards from the trailhead. Since the restaurant wasn’t open yet, the lot was all but empty, and we were able to quickly park, lace up our sneakers and take to the trail.

The hike is a 2.5-mile loop, and shortly after crossing a small creek, we were met with a junction. We took the trail to the right, which offered a steady incline and regular views of the ocean. We lucked out with a clear day – the water was a deep blue, and flowers ranging from lupine to small sunflowers covered the landscape. As we continued, however, the climb grew steeper and the plants thicker. The winter rains had done their job, and the trail was mostly overgrown. Instead of completing the loop, we turned back for a leisurely stroll downhill. We made friends with fellow hikers, lizards, a caterpillar and Billy the dog, whose idea of hiking was just to lie in the shade. Good thinking, Billy.

When we were almost back at the parking lot, a hand on my arm stopped me abruptly – just a few feet in front of me, a rattlesnake’s tail slid silently into the bushes. That’s a friend to watch out for, as well.

## Malibu Seafood

[img647 fullwidth]

A little jittery from that close encounter, I hurried back to our car, just in time for Malibu Seafood to open its doors. The parking lot had filled up, and a line was starting to form underneath the restaurant's sign, which features the image of a red lobster in a Hawaiian shirt.

The menu has just about every kind of seafood you can think of – clams, mussels, calamari, halibut, generic unidentified fish – to go along with an order of french fries. To try something new, I ordered a grilled giant squid steak and a basket of fried scallops.

[img646 fullwidth]

We took our buzzer and tried to find a table in the restaurant’s shaded pavilion, which was a challenge because the hot sun had deterred most customers from the outdoor options. But we managed, and our food arrived relatively quickly. My scallops all but melted in my mouth, and the squid steak was mildly chewy and wholly delicious, as long as I didn’t think about what I was eating. My friend’s mussels also looked like fried food heaven, and I had to snag a bite. Can confirm – mussels are great.

We cleaned our plates and patted our stomachs, satisfied. Although Malibu Seafood’s menu is more on the pricey end, it was a pit stop worth taking, especially before the beach.

## El Matador State Beach

Not wanting to get stuck on a crowded beach on a Saturday, we drove about 9 miles west of the restaurant to El Matador State Beach, avoiding popular Zuma and Point Dume.

The beach, tucked within rocky bluffs, is accessible by a steep trail and a set of stairs. I made my way down and took off my shoes, and we searched for a sandy spot to lay out our towels. There were plenty of people around, sunbathing or taking photos by the large rocks protruding from the water, but it didn’t feel too crowded. If anything, El Matador is a swell beach for people-watching.

At least two professional photo shoots seemed to be in progress when we arrived. On one side of a rock, two women wore glittery makeup, pastel dresses and seashell crowns. They posed with serious expressions for the camera, I assume evoking their inner mermaids. On the other side, a male model in red board shorts ran around in circles tossing a football to himself, while a photographer snapped the action. In the water, two surfers were trying to catch tiny waves, flipping their hair every time they emerged from the water. It all felt very LA.

But it was just a typical beach as well, with typical beach activities. We built a sand castle, spotted sea lions, explored small sea caves and ran out of the ocean screaming from the cold. The only reasons we left were to prevent sunburn and beat the traffic home.

## Strawberry stands

[img649 fullwidth]

Feeling a bit dehydrated from the sun, I was in the mood for a smoothie.

We made a U-turn on the PCH to check out a joint a friend told me about, but a big white sign with a bright red strawberry painted on it hailed us down first. Strawberries are my favorite fruit, so naturally we had to stop. We parked in a turnout next to a convertible with the top down and made our way over to the fruit vendor. The strawberries were giant, sweet and delicious. We purchased half a box, only to determine that wasn’t nearly enough, and went back for more.

It’s a shame that strawberries are seasonal fruits, otherwise this would be my go-to stop in Malibu all year round.

## SunLife Organics

[img651 fullwidth]

Back on track, I was ready for that smoothie.

The overall vibe in SunLife Organics was very no-shirt-no-shoes-no-problem, as shirtless and bikini-clad customers crowded the succulent-decorated counter, ordering fresh-pressed juices and acai bowls.

The restaurant specializes in smoothies, juices, and superfood products using ingredients like kale, bee pollen, raw cacao, chia seeds and buffered vitamin C crystals – whatever that means. I was feeling mildly adventurous and ordered the Fountain of Youth, one of their signature superfood shakes. It contained strawberries, bananas, acai, goji, resveratrol, coconut and apple juice. I only didn’t recognize two of those ingredients, so it felt like a safe pick. I wasn’t sure what I was expecting from the flavor, but overall I was pleasantly surprised. It tasted as a normal smoothie should taste, but with a somewhat chalky texture reminiscent of a milkshake.

I don’t think I’m hip enough to frequent SunLife, but as I sipped my youth-preserving drink on the ride home, I found myself thinking about the next Malibu day trip and what shake I would try then – perhaps the one with grass-fed whey protein isolate? Maybe not.
