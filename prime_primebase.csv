234,Toe Shoes to Textbooks: Retired ballerina finds balance at UCLA,toe-shoes-textbooks,"Victoria Canelos, 28, is a fourth-year physiology student. Before transferring to UCLA she was a professional ballerina, an experience she carries with her.","[img6 right]

If a younger Victoria Canelos wasn’t wearing toe shoes eight hours a day, she was probably wondering why she was even waking up.

Her mother introduced her to ballet when she was 4 years old, and by the time she was 8, the now 28-year-old physiology student at UCLA said she was sure she wanted to be a ballerina.

She didn’t think a career in ballet would leave time for college.

And when she was consistently told she would never make it as a professional ballerina, she kept pushing to show she could be the best.

At 13, she was invited to study at the Kirov Academy of Ballet’s branch in Washington, D.C., a boarding school for classical ballet that accepted a few students from around the world.

“If I said no, that would have been the end of her professional dance life,” said her mother, Victoria Canelos Sr. “I always told my children you’re gonna get older whether or not you sit on the couch eating bonbons, or if you achieve your dreams.”

It was at the academy that she first started to turn to eating disorders to deal with her only persistent imperfection from a ballet standpoint: her weight. The pressure to conform to the ballet world’s idea of a perfect body, mixed with loneliness and exhaustion, at times tempted her to go home.

""(But) there was nothing for me in Tucson, so I refused to come home,” she said.

Her talent took her across the country and around the world, leading as Clara in multiple productions of “The Nutcracker” and performing in Prague.

She eventually stopped for her health and enrolled in community college to pursue an education, a way to get fulfillment even after an early retirement.

“You can understand walking on the fine line between (being) so in love with something and willing to do whatever it takes to do it,” she said. “If you cross that line for a second who knows if you’ll be able to come back.”

# Ballerina boarding school

The routine at the academy was unlike any American school she had heard of or experienced. Practicing ballet six days a week, often for more than eight hours a day, left little time for making friends or academics – and the prevailing use of French and Russian by her demanding instructors meant she was always around an interpreter.

[img7 right]

She still remembers when Madame Sizova told her that her 90-year-old grandmother had better feet.

And when she told her she could see Canelos’ Thanksgiving dinner from last year.

They told her if she didn’t look good in a tutu, it didn’t matter how perfect her form was.

“Weight was my whole experience as a dancer professionally, and in school,” Canelos said. “Weight was the first thing I thought about in the morning. Weight is the last thing I thought about before I went to bed.”

But then she also remembers when she finished her recital and received a kiss on the cheek and Madame Sizova told her she had never been more proud in her life.

Those moments made it worth it.

# Life without a backup plan

Canelos graduated from the ballet academy in 2003 as valedictorian.

Despite her success, she did not get any offers from companies.

“None of us had plan Bs,” she said.

She auditioned for the Miami City Ballet in Florida. The director expressed concern that Canelos was not their style, although her technique was up to par.

[img9 fullwidth]

Canelos asked him if she could stay for the summer. She told him she would prove she could fit in with the company.

She lost weight – probably too much. She mimicked the other dancers. Ate what they ate. Dressed like them. She “went method,” so to speak.

And by the end of the summer, she landed the job.

Her determination was effective again after an audition in New York in 2006.

Competing against thousands of girls, she almost made it into her favorite company, Complexions Contemporary Ballet – but finished in second place.

With what she considers a stroke of luck, the company called a few days later and said she needed to be at work on Monday. One of the ballerinas had broken her hip.

She decided to take a chance. She immediately withdrew from her dance classes at the University of Arizona, packed her bags and flew by herself to a city where she knew nobody. Canelos took the job without a contract, hoping she might be allowed to stay.

The catch was that she had nowhere to live and no time to sort out any arrangements. At the beginning, she stayed with family in New Jersey and commuted every day at 5 a.m. Eventually this routine became impractical.

So she stayed a few days here and there, renting out spare bedrooms for a couple of days at a time, finding listings on Craigslist, until she finally found an apartment.

“It was my first time as an adult in New York. I was just there to dance and working really hard,” she said. “I felt like I was living the dream.”

# A book for her thoughts

While in New York, a woman started giving Canelos books to read in her free time. She remembers the first was “The Pillars of the Earth.”

A slow and enthralling read, it kept her attention long enough to finish the book – something she had never experienced before. Reading had not been a priority in her life thus far. As she began to read more, she found herself wondering what it might be like to be in school again.

That, she said, mixed with her constant struggle with weight and eating disorders, led her to make the choice she had previously refused.

“As much as I love ballet, I (thought) I might not be cut out for it as much as I thought I was. I thought I might die sooner than I should. It was a difficult decision for me,” she said.

[img8 left]

Bouts of anorexia and laxative abuse had led her to hospitalization and a history of what she calls “weird eating habits.”

Being a ballerina in New York, and a ballerina for Complexions specifically, was like being at the top of the social hierarchy.

“I loved being a big deal,” Canelos said, laughing.

However, her eating disorders and rigorous dance schedule meant she couldn’t socialize and eat with friends, making it difficult to enjoy her success.

She thought quitting ballet might give her a chance to do something more with her life.

“(I was once told) it doesn’t matter what it feels like to you, Victoria, it matters what other people see. As much as it is lovely to bring joy to the audience, it’sso self-centered and so self-absorbed. I can’t tell you what a relief it is to not be in a career like that anymore.”

# Back to school

She enrolled at Orange Coast College in Orange County in 2010, starting with high school-level math since she had not taken many standard academic course sat the academy.

Her academic history made her eligible for Extended Opportunity Programs andServices, an academic counseling program for educationally or financially disadvantaged students.

“She started here, but because of her intelligence she is capable of doing anything, and more important than anything is her wonderful heart,” said Vida Shajie,an academic counselor and professor of counseling services.

Canelos became the president of the program’s honors club and emphasized community service during her term. Service was something she said she realized she loved, but hadn’t frequently experienced as a ballerina on a cutthroat stage.

Of her two years at community college, she said her most rewarding experience was when she helped raise money for the adult transition program on campus.

When she asked around and learned their department was sponsored by a state program and didn’t have enough funding, she personally wrote grants and went door to door to raise $12,000 for new iPads, clothing, furniture, microwaves and toys.

“I have never felt so worthy of my life than I did then,” she said. She described it as the second happiest time in her life. The first would always be her first ballet job.

Since then, Canelos said she knew she wanted to work with underserved populations.

Her mother, whom she considers “a far more interesting woman” than herself,might be responsible for her desire to help people. Around the time Canelos was in elementary school, her mother, a nurse,spent a year in Panama and brought her children with her.

While her mother was working to help struggling mothers in Panama support their families, Canelos would practice ballet and play with the local children.

The bumpy, warped dance floors at the studio in Panama introduced her to dancers with lifestyles different than the ones she was used to.

# Pursuing medicine

[img10 fullwidth]

Since transferring to UCLA in 2012, Canelos has pursued research and education to prepare her for medical school.

“I feel like it’s in my blood to do something like that,” Canelos said about helping people. “I’m a care extender (at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center) – I have the best time ever as a care extender.”

She said she particularly enjoys working with the children in the intensive care unit.

“I take them on walks,” she said. “I don’t care if it’s (just) in a circle around their room.”

Sometimes she brings her nail polish and paints the little girls’ nails.

“She’s lived her whole life looking at her body in the mirror, studying the way it functions,” her mother said. “Medicine makes sense.”

The transition to medicine has at times been difficult. But being a doctor is worth the struggle, she said.

Like ballet, it takes discipline.

“You really can’t be successful or enjoy your life (as either) unless you love both of them,” she said. “If you’re going be a really good doctor you’re going to do research, you’re going to make sure patients have the best care.”

Regardless, nobody will ever convince her that being a doctor is better than being a ballerina, she said.

“I want to be a doctor more than any- thing. And I will be a doctor. (But) that will never come out of my mouth to even compare,” she said. “(It’s) like comparing apples to blueberries.”

Ballet is something she will always take with her.

“I think we have 50 toe shoes she can’t give away, or 75 leotards she can’t seem to get rid of,” her mother said, laughing.

On Saturdays, Canelos still practices ballet in Los Angeles.

[img11 fullwidth]

“There is nothing like walking up to a ballet bar and putting up my left hand and coming into first position and stacking (my) spine and pelvis ... nothing like putting myself in there and being so centered and knowing that is the most comfortable place for me,” she said, smiling.

“Doing the very first plié for me is like eating after not eating for a long time. It’s like being starved and here is some warm soup for you.”","",0,,ARTICLE,1
235,Recipe: Apple pie pops usher in flavors of fall,apple-pie-pops-recipe,"In the spirit of fall, food blogger Amy Giroux cooks up some apple pie pops using an online recipe.","The cake pop craze is dying down just in time for its hipper cousin, the pie pop, to steal the scene.

Introducing the apple pie pop, in all of its fall flavor glory. The start of a new school year brings new adventures, cozy clothes, pumpkin spice lattes and a revisiting of all of fall season’s favorite recipes.

Relatively simple to make, this “pinteresting” recipe is a winning addition to any dinner party, afternoon picnic, Sunday afternoon baking session, study snack, late-night splurge or even breakfast treat.

# Ingredients:

[img12 fullwidth]

- 4 Fuji apples, peeled and medium-small diced

- ¼ cup white sugar, plus 1/8 teaspoon white sugar for egg wash

- ¼ cup brown sugar

- 2 tablespoons honey

- ½ teaspoon cinnamon

- 3 tablespoons apricot jam (can be substituted with strawberry or peach for different flavors)

- 2 tablespoons corn starch

- 2 tablespoons water

- 1 egg yolk

- ¼ cup milk

- Kosher salt

- 2 refrigerated pie crusts

# Instructions:

[img13 fullwidth]

Preheat oven to 400° F. In a medium saucepan, bring apples, sugar, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, jam and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt to a light simmer on medium-low heat. Simmer for 15-20 minutes on low heat with the saucepan uncovered.

----------

[img14 fullwidth]

Combine water and corn starch with a fork to create a slurry, and slowly pour into the apple mixture while stirring. Let cook for 2 minutes. Take off the heat and let cool.

----------

[img15 fullwidth]

Prepare egg wash by mixing an egg yolk, milk, 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/8 teaspoon sugar. (not pictured)

----------

[img16 fullwidth]

Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. Take out one refrigerated pie crust and cut out as many circles as possible (around 12). Place them on the parchment paper. Place the lollipop sticks at the top of each pie circle and push them in, but not so they go all the way through the circle.

----------

[img17 fullwidth]

Place around 1 to 2 teaspoons of apple filling in the middle of each pie circle. Roll out the second pie crust and cut out the same number of circles as from the first pie crust.

----------

[img18 fullwidth]

Brush egg wash using the back of a spoon or a pastry brush on the rim around the filling for the pie pops. Cover the filling and seal with the remaining pie circles. Press the edges together with a fork and poke holes into the tops of each pie, just puncturing the crust.

----------

[img19 fullwidth]

Brush the tops with more egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 400° F for 15-20 minutes, or just until the crust is golden brown.

----------

[img20 fullwidth]

## Tips from our kitchen to yours:

- Don’t skip the apricot jam or corn starch in this recipe – these are the secrets to perfect consistency in the pie filling.

- Mix and match the apples to your taste for a full realm of flavors – we used a combination of Pink Lady, Fuji and Gala.

- Healthier substitutions can also be made with agave in lieu of honey, and coconut milk in lieu of whole milk.

- No lollipop sticks? No problem. Chopsticks make the perfect substitute (and dare we say they’re even more effective because they are substantial enough to hold the surprisingly weighty little pie).

- If you can, try to resist the temptation to eat the pops right away. Allowing them to cool will prevent the pies from sliding down the sticks.

236,A Perfect Day in LA: Exploring Downtown Los Angeles’ Grand Central Market,exploring-downtown-la-grand-central-market,Prime staff spent an afternoon at Grand Central Market and shared their experience with readers as part of the quarterly series “Perfect Day in LA.”,"*The original version of this article contained an error and has been changed. See the bottom of the article for additional information.*

Each quarter, prime staff will try something new in Los Angeles and share their “Perfect Day in LA” with readers. This issue, Alessandra Daskalakis and Erin Ng took a Sunday afternoon trip to Grand Central Market, located at 317 S. Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles.

Walking into the market is sensory overload.

Old friends sit at booths, hunch at counters, laughing and drinking from glass bottles of Mexican Coca-Cola with the telltale “refresco” written on the labels. Families with two, three, even five children crowd picnic tables eating and smiling.

The air is filled with the smell of cooking meats and Asian food.

The conversations are complemented by the fast-paced pitter-patter of capable hands shaping pupusas.

An occasional burst of steam from the grills and rays of sun shining through from the other side of the street give the impression that the market itself is taking deep breaths.

Vendors at the market offer primarily Latin and Asian cuisine, each with a slightly different take on the menu.

China Cafe, a Chinese diner located at the back of the market, serves boiled noodles, egg fo yeung and other fare. Many of the customers drink Corona and coffee brews in coffee pots on the counter. Mexican hot sauces adorn the tables, ready to spike up the spice of wonton soups.

[img36 fullwidth]

Behind containers of hundreds of chiles from Mexico and mounds of dry beans, Angel Yépez stands, smiling. He has been watching us walk around taking photos and talking to tenants. He knows it’s his turn.

He welcomes us to Valeria’s and we ask which chili is the best.

“Guajillo,” he says. It’s their best seller — good for making menudo and enchiladas.

Valeria’s is one of the few booths that has been at the market since it opened in 1917. Yépez has been working there since the ’80s.

He says the booth regularly attracts photographers and points to a customer with a camera. In fact, as I’m talking to him, Erin walks around snapping photos of the colorful chiles in transparent containers. From the beginning she had scoped this booth out as a good photo opportunity.

[img33 fullwidth]

We asked Yépez if he has seen the market change and he nods his head right away.

He says in the past two years he has seen more white customers at the traditionally Latino market. He said he is curious to see what the demographic will be in the next eight months.

A couple of booths away, a chalkboard menu and a Twitter handle advertise Valerie at Grand Central Market, a diner serving items like kale hand pie and salmon bahn mi. Yepéz wonders if the higher prices will make it difficult for some customers to afford.

Around the corner from Valeria’s is Sarita’s Pupuseria, a family business open since 1983.

[img34 fullwidth]

I watch, mesmerized by the pupusa prepping process, and eventually ask if I can speak to someone about the shop. A woman directs me to Candelario Serrano Ayon, who is helping a young girl and her father. As Ayon works the cash register, the father and daughter ask us if we’ve had the pupusas. Not yet.

I can’t help but ask how many pupusas they might make in a day. But Ayon laughs and just says “a lot.”

I start with the same set of questions I have been asking the other vendors.

“What do you like about the market?”

[img31 right]

The diversity, he says. All different kinds of people come to eat.

When I told him I was a reporter, he smiled, leaned over the counter and pointed to a booth just to his right, insisting we talk to his brother, who runs a jewelry booth that opened in 1988.

Like her brother-in-law, Sara Clark, who helps run her husband’s jewelry booth, said some aspects of the market have changed, but the constant hustle and bustle has always kept her from getting bored. Even as she speaks to me she curiously looks around at the goings on, trying to find the right words in Spanish to prove her point. Sometimes she looks back at her husband to confirm the dates. He’s eating the wonton soup from China Cafe.

[img30 left]

Ramon Molina, who works at Torres Produce, is a little less optimistic about the market compared to his peers. Molina, who has been with the booth since its opening in 1985, said he has seen the market go through many changes recently. He points behind him to the future site of Belcampo Meat Co., an organic butcher shop.

He said it makes him nervous because the previous vendor had been at the market longer than they have. Adjusting his Boston Rockets hat, he said bad weather in Mexico has affected their produce and profits as of late.

The future feels uncertain. Recently, customers have asked if it is true the booth will leave, but he said all he can say is “I don’t know.” As he points to a photo on a wall a few feet away, my attention is brought to an image of the market 50 years ago.

Changes to Grand Central Market are not unknown to Angelenos.

Wanting to know about the changes myself, I later spoke to Christophe Farber, director of business development for the market.

[img29 right]

He said the market has 10 new vendors since late 2012, four of which are already open. After their leasing term was up, some previous vendors chose to leave. When this happened, the owners of the market took the opportunity to find new tenants that would reflect the changing demographic of downtown Los Angeles and the city’s evolving food culture.

“People are starting to pay more attention to the origin and history of the meats and produce,” Farber said.

That explains DTLA Cheese and Belcampo Meat Co., both of which are opening soon. But that doesn’t mean the older vendors are going anywhere.

“We have the best pupusas in town,” he said, laughing.

Some of the oldest businesses in the market not only have a history, but are also thriving, Farber said. It wouldn’t make sense to get rid of them and there is no pressure for vendors to leave.

It’s true that some of the prices will be higher, but that’s just the way it is.

[img32 left]

“The demographic of the market is in the same state of flux as the city and downtown Los Angeles,” he said. “You see a lot more urban dwellers, so we’re trying to make a direct effort to address everyone.”

Before heading home I saw a woman eating by herself at a table for two under a yellow-tile archway. She looked like a regular and I wanted to know what she thought about the changes.

Nervously, I introduced myself in Spanish as a UCLA student. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. At first she looked confused, but as I elaborated that I wanted to share stories from the market in the magazine, she introduced herself as Maria Gomez. She likes to walk to the market for lunch after work.

We talked about her favorite tacos, pork and intestines, and how she had been coming to the market for many years now.

When I asked if she had seen the market change, she shook her head. Families still come and enjoy good food together. What makes the market great is its ability to get us away from the busy life just outside its boundaries.

“The market is the only distraction we have from home, isn’t it?” she said in Spanish, laughing.

After a couple of minutes I thanked her for her time and apologized for my broken, self-conscious Spanish. She lit up with a warm smile, encouraging me.

“The only thing that matters is that we understand each other,” she said in Spanish. “And we did.”

I’d say it was a pretty perfect day in Los Angeles.

237,A Grandfather's Legacy: Saffron and Rose Ice Cream owners carry on tradition,saffron-rose-ice-cream,"Saffron & Rose is a popular Persian ice cream shop south of Wilshire. Since his grandfather died, Fred Papen and his family have been continuing the legacy.","[img1 right]

Just about a block or two south of Wilshire a line forms out the door of a small shop. Inside, customers are greeted by cool air and the familiar, sweet smell of ice cream.

“That’s the best seller,” Fred Papen said, pointing to the pastel green-colored Saffron Pistachio ice cream in the display case.He carefully scoops out a small sample with a plastic spoon and gives it to a customer, something he has done since he was about 5 years old.

He switches between English and Farsi throughout the night, serving customers who know the shop well and introducing the flavors to curious newcomers.
Up until three years ago, his late grandfather’s voice would energize this popular Persian ice cream shop on Westwood Boulevard.

Haji Ali Kashani-Rafye isn’t around anymore, but his picture decorates the white containers of Saffron & Rose Ice Cream – a tribute to the man who built the business with his honesty, charismatic personality and broken English.

“My grandfather was so old, yet he connected with everyone – all ages, all races,” Papen said. “Even people that didn’t understand his English very well – he still connected with them.”

# Coming to America

Kashani-Rafye immigrated to California from Iran in 1974 to be closer to his son, who was studying in the U.S. and wanted to settle down in the country.

He used his father’s secret saffron ice cream and rose ice cream recipes to open a small grocery and ice cream shop in Santa Monica.

After changing locations a few times over the years, Kashani-Rafye settled down in the heart of Little Persia, a small enclave of Persian businesses that overlaps with Westwood.

Kashani-Rafye decided to open an ice cream shop in a more accessible location as word of his ice cream spread.

Unsure of what to name the place, his grandson suggested it seemed fitting to name it after his two most popular flavors: saffron and rose.

Saffron ice cream, bright yellow in color, is bittersweet. Rose ice cream on the other hand, is white, smells like rose water and has chunks of high quality cream called “khameh” incorporated into the authentic Persian ice cream.

“When it comes to cold desserts (in Persia), those two pretty much take the cake,” Papen said.

Saffron & Rose Ice Cream is now one of the biggest brands of Persian ice cream in the United States and sold nationwide.

Persian ice cream stands apart from its American and Italian counterparts with its use of whole milk. American ice cream is made from powdered milk and gelato uses both milk and water.

[img4 fullwidth]

“If you take a spoon (of Persian ice cream) and pull it from a cup, it would behave like melted cheese,” Papen said. “It stretches instead of breaking up.”
Kashani-Rafye spent almost 40 years working in his shop after immigrating to the United States, trying to perfect his secret ice cream recipes.

He died in 2010 after having a heart attack, leaving the business in his family’s hands.

Though it was hard to come to terms with her father’s sudden death, Fery Kashani said she and her brother felt comfortable taking charge because of the support they got from the community.

Hundreds of people attended Kashani-Rafye’s funeral and memorial ceremony. Now, three years later, people still come by the shop and talk about how they miss Kashani-Rafye. It happens multiple times every day, Papen said.

As Kashani and Papen sat outside Saffron & Rose to discuss the business’ history on a chilly September night, they occasionally paused to greet their regular customers as if they were longtime friends.

Caren Avedon, a Westwood resident, visits the shop a couple of times a week, sometimes bringing her sister along with her.

Avedon, 54, first discovered the ice cream shop when she was at a wine tasting on a patio nearby.

Although she moved out of the area soon after, Avedon rediscovered the shop while visiting a nearby restaurant last year after moving back. She went inside to have some ice cream for dessert, remembering the nice man with an infectious laugh who had served her ice cream a year before.

[img5 fullwidth]

“It’s just like you see it right now  – how it’s all family. People from every walk of life come here and they are just happy,” Avedon said.

Children, students, professionals and retirees stopped by to get ice cream on one busy Friday night. Papen would often make flavor suggestions to newcomers.

“(Papen) gave me a dark chocolate chip with orange blossom ice cream and that was it – I was hooked for life,” Avedon said.

Customers keep coming back to Saffron & Rose, not only because of the good ice cream, but because of the legacy that Kashani-Rafye left behind.

“He just left a good name behind him. In our community, everybody knows (of) him,” Kashani said. “And I am so proud and happy that people like us, they know us.”

# Growing up in the shop

Papen remembers his secret handshake with his grandfather. After an elaborate combination of fist bumps, they would end by touching their thumbs together in the form of a thumbs-up.

From wrestling and secret handshakes to learning life lessons, Papen spent as much time as possible with his grandfather when he was younger.

[img3 left]

He grew up around his grandfather’s ice cream shop, pretending to serve customers under his grandfather’s supervision.

Kashani-Rafye adored Papen and tried to involve him in the family business early on. When he was 10 years old, Papen took on small tasks like cleaning windows.

Little by little, he started getting more involved.

“One day turned into two days, three days, more hours,” Kashani said.

In high school, Papen would stop by after class to help clean up and stock the shelves.

He got his first job at the shop when he was 19-years-old, driving ice cream across Southern California in a Ford cargo van.

Papen didn’t really consider working at Saffron & Rose until he experienced what it was like to work for other businesses.

Taking a few years off from attending California State University, Northridge, he worked odd jobs – at a local restaurant in Westwood, at a golf course and as an after-school coach at Culver City Middle School.

“I realized it’s not much of an investment. I work twelve hours a day, I get a paycheck and that’s it,” he said. “I can get fired tomorrow and that’s it for me.”
And so he decided to get more involved with Saffron & Rose, where he could do more than just clock in and out.

# The next generation

[img2 right]

Even though he’s the newest addition to the Saffron & Rose management, Kashani said her son’s insight is valuable.

Kashani oversees the managerial aspects of the business, while her brother Mike Kash is responsible for product development and distribution.
The family didn’t do much marketing early on – business grew through word of mouth, Kash said.

Papen, however, wants to take a new approach by focusing on branding and advertising.

Running a family business does have its challenges, Kashani said.

“She’s my mom and my boss, so we’ll argue about ice cream (as work) and then when we go home, we’ll argue about whatever,” Papen said. “You can never get away from it.”

He constantly tries to apply the lessons he learned from his grandfather to his day-to-day work at Saffron & Rose.

Sometimes, Papen will give a child free ice cream or offer samples to customers, just like his grandfather used to.

“Watching him, I realized how effective it is to give someone something, even if it costs a dollar. It just causes good karma and vibes to go around,” Papen said, as he pointed to his grandfather’s portrait on the shop’s window.

That sense of community, he said, is why Saffron & Rose is so special to him.

“I see it as something that will help me financially grow in the future, “ Papen said. “But more importantly, I see it like a continuation of my grandfather and what he left behind.”

Kashani looked at her son and nodded in agreement.

“Yes. … We’re keeping his name alive, that’s the most important thing for us,” Kashani added.","",8,,ARTICLE,1
238,Seen Not Heard: Experience of overweight students on campus often overlooked,seen-not-heard,"Alexandra Tashman, an opinion columnist at the Daily Bruin, writes about what it’s like being overweight at UCLA. This is a story she has wanted to tell.","November 12, 2013

[img28 fullwidth]

I’m overweight. And I don’t mean that in the “let-me-stand-in-front-of-my-Forever-21-dressing-room-and-have-my-friends-bolster-my-self-esteem” kind of way. I mean that in the honest to God, “I-should-star-in-a-Nutrisystem-commercial” sense.

I’ve been overweight throughout my over two-year journey at UCLA so far and, although it’s been a happy one, this is one facet of my life I cannot ignore, even when I want to. To be overweight on a college campus is to be invisible at best, and too visible at worst. It’s harder to make friends when you’re overweight, but everyone notices when you fall down a flight of stairs.

The reason I want to write publicly about this is not because I’m looking for anyone to tell me how to go on a diet, or to make judgments on my life or on the lives of other overweight UCLA community members. But for all we talk about diverse points of view and experiences on this campus, the day-to-day struggle of being overweight is nearly always forgotten.

Why? Do we, as a society, look at overweight people and think that it’s their fault? That it’s just a matter of willpower? That someone needs to just tell them to diet and exercise and the problem will solve itself? That they’re choosing to be this way?

Everybody’s story is different. Some people are overweight because of medical conditions and genetics. Binge eating disorder is a leading cause of obesity for many and will continue to be recognized as such. And some people are just overweight and are perfectly healthy.

Because our campus is located practically in Bel Air, UCLA students may be more vulnerable to the pressures of Hollywood and the media. As an overweight student here, and a lifelong resident, I know that I have keenly felt the pressure to look and dress a certain way.

It is because of this backdrop that I think it is especially important to let the voices of people who are overweight be heard, to share some of the less-nice aspects of being a UCLA student.

My experience here has been rich and multifaceted, but the moments where I have been reduced to nothing but my weight are just as telling as those when I have felt invincibly happy. Here are a few stories about what being overweight on UCLA’s campus has felt like to me.

On my first day of classes at UCLA, I spent 25 minutes crying in the women’s bathroom in Broad Art Center.

I had always loved the first day of school: discovering new rooms and pathways, meeting new people, developing new routines in my head. Having fantasized about starting college since I knew it existed, my mind was full of romantic and idealized notions of what college lectures and professors would be like. I probably should have spent less time watching “Gilmore Girls” growing up.

Anyway, I was running late to my first class – European history, my favorite – and by the time I finally found the right classroom I was completely out of breath. Trying to figure out where I could sit without looking too eager, I picked an aisle desk somewhere near the front and attempted to sit down.

I didn’t fit.

I didn’t fit in the chair – I was just too big. No matter which way I leaned, which leg I crossed, I could not squeeze my way into that chair. I felt like everyone was staring at me. Eventually, I managed to defy physics and somehow squish myself into the seat before laughably trying to put the desk down over my stomach. That didn’t fit either.

Resigning myself to feeling uncomfortably scrunched, I looked over to see the girl next to me glaring – my shoulders and arms were taking up some of her space.

At the end of class, my legs sore from keeping them in one contorted position for too long, my scowling neighbor turned to me and suggested that I find better seating during the next lecture so I wouldn’t be a problem for anyone else. But what constitutes “non-problematic” seating in a lecture hall filled with identical chairs?

Tired and frustrated, I walked out of the room, into the second floor bathroom, locked myself in a stall and cried. I was so embarrassed that I couldn’t remember what the eagerly anticipated lecture had even been about.

This was not what college was supposed to be like.

In February of my freshman year, I was sitting in De Neve dining hall during dinner.

I was eating a sandwich and waiting for my friend to finish filling her tray when a blond girl I didn’t know sat down right across from me at my table. I looked up, surprised, and said hello.

In short, she told me that the salad bar was on the other side of the dining hall, and she wanted to make sure I knew where it was in case I needed any help with my diet.

But more importantly, I’ll never forget the exact wording of what she said to me next: “Believe me, if you stick to the salad bar, you’ll be looking acceptable in no time.”

Sometimes, I walk the track at Drake Stadium because it’s flat and well lit at night. Occasionally, I’ll even make an attempt at jogging a lap.

It takes a lot for me to work myself up into going over to the track. Workout clothes are enough of a nightmare, not to mention the fact that I often have to go alone if my friends are busy.

One night, in the middle of my second year, as I was jogging along and completely out of breath, I heard someone laugh. Then several people laughed, before they were shushed by the rest of their friends.

I looked over to see a group of guys sitting in the bleachers. They were looking right back at me. Another one laughed loudly before being silenced again.

It took me about a minute to realize they were laughing at me – the idea of my jogging was funny to them. Fat people running has been a comedic trope in film and television for decades, and in an instant I had gone from normal human being to Chunk from “The Goonies.”

Humiliated, I slowed to a walk as one guy kept laughing. I don’t think I’ve gone jogging since.

The point of telling these stories is not to engender sympathy. Rather, they are meant to demonstrate the ways in which everyday activities can become incidents of shame and embarrassment because of something as pointlessly divisive as weight.

Why does body weight change the value and character of another human being? What is so bad about fat that it makes public mockery acceptable?

Whether I am actively trying to lose weight or not, I wake up every day with the knowledge that people are judging me on sight for something they don’t understand. They don’t know my story, but immediately they will make assumptions about me.

And it is precisely for that reason that I devote my time to making sure people understand there is more to me than my weight – I am funny, I am kind, I drink a lot of coffee and can name every British monarch from memory – and none of that has anything to do with size. The fact that I have to consciously dedicate time to trying to prove I am normal says a lot more about our culture than my weight says about me.

Everybody has laughed at a fat joke. People every day are complicit in the public shame and mockery of those who are overweight. The reason I tell these stories, more than anything, is to raise consciousness about what it is like to be overweight every day – the small, completely undeserved injustices and indignities that are painful and often completely preventable.

It is scary to tell your stories, to fear that others will judge you or laugh at you. But I live my life undeterred – I am here, I am not invisible, and I am no less because of how big I am.","",4,,ARTICLE,1
239,DIY craft: How to turn old maps into artful posters,turn-maps-into-artful-posters-diy,Many people have an old map wasting away in a glove compartment somewhere. Prime photo editor Erin Ng has a decorative solution.,"[img21 fullwidth]

[img22 fullwidth]

Pick your map of choice. Maps with a glossy finish will not work as well for this craft. Add two tablespoons of instant coffee to two cups of hot water and stir to dissolve. The more coffee you add, the darker your map will be. Let the coffee come to room temperature.

----------

[img23 fullwidth]

Unfold your map to a size that fits comfortably into your baking tray. You should have the map side face up in order to soak in more color. Pour the coffee on top of the map, making sure it is completely wet. You may have to push the map down deeper into the tray in order to get full coverage once the coffee is added.

----------

[img24 fullwidth]

Let the map soak for 10 to15 minutes, flipping it over about halfway through. Carefully take the map out of the tray, letting any remaining coffee drip back into the tray. The map is fragile and can easily rip if not handled carefully.

# Blazers

Most college students own a blazer in some form or another, whether it is collecting dust until their next job interview or part of their everyday style.

Blazers are extremely versatile. When you’re hurrying off to class, they will put your look together instantly, and they are also perfect for dining out or dressing up.

There are no rules, but men tend to prefer a darker-toned jacket. A well-cut blazer will instantly make a fun graphic tee a little more serious, without being boring. Women are often spotted wearing bright blazers, which look fantastic over otherwise neutral tones, on a daily basis and for fancier events.

# Pants

Another easy way to make a simple look much more fun is to pair it with some statement pants.

Although you might not want to wear these for a gala, first date or meeting with the dean, they are great for your daily stroll around campus or a casual evening out with your friends.

It is usually safer to pair bright or loudly patterned pants with basic staples, possibly in black, white or gray, in order to avoid pattern overkill. As a general rule, keeping it simple and classy will make even the craziest of pants an integral part of an elegant outfit.

# Boat shoes

Boat shoes and men’s loafers have been around for a while. They were probably most of our grandfathers’ shoe of choice back in the day. Does this mean that they can’t be cool? Absolutely not.

These shoes are a classic for young men and women alike. Wear them to class, for dinner or a night out, and you’ll always look the part. A preppy piece, boat shoes work incredibly well with boat shorts and a T-shirt or button-up, but can also be worn with jeans – or even a suit. For women as well, these shoes are a staple for any occasion. They not only make a sleek finishing touch to a cute dress, but also work for skinny jeans and a pretty top.

241,A Feast for Your Ryes: Los Angeles’ tried and true late-night delis,los-angeles-late-night-delis,A good sandwich is a lot more than a quick meal. Digital Managing Editor Kate Parkinson-Morgan found some of LA’s best delis and tried the pastrami at each.,"The word “deli” conjures up a few classic images.

Among them, a few gruff, plump men serving piles of steaming-hot pastrami sandwiches to a long line of impatient New Yorkers.

“You want me to show you what the New York deli mentality is?” asks Norm Langer, owner of Langer’s Deli in Downtown Los Angeles. He leans in, rumples his brow and puts on a thick New York accent, “I’m gonna tell you what you want and that’s what you’re gonna get.”

In Los Angeles, that motto doesn’t fly. Customers want friendly service, a solid dose of nostalgia and a sandwich that makes a statement.

The price they’re willing to pay for these qualities isn’t cheap. All the hand-cut and cured meats, made-fresh coleslaws and piles of pickles add up.

While there may be a dearth of traditional delis in Westwood, there are plenty in the greater Los Angeles area. Here are four spots worth checking out. For the sake of consistency, we sampled the signature sandwich at each location.

# Izzy’s Deli

- “The Deli Next Door”
- 1433 Wilshire Blvd. Santa Monica, CA 90403
- Open 24 hours
- Established: 1973

[img69 fullwidth]

There's a kind of understanding among deli connoisseurs that sandwiches are more than, well, just sandwiches. They’re infused with history, constructed with care and, in the case of Izzy’s, they are named after loved ones, dead and alive.

Owner Izzy Freeman, the “Deli Lama” as the back of the menu proudly proclaims, named most of his dishes after friends and family. Servers greet you with a warm smile as you enter from the corner of 15th Street and Wilshire Boulevard, and ask whether you’d like to sit at the counter, facing the noisy kitchen, or in one of the cozy booths.

[img55 left]

The pastrami – rather, Craig’s Hot Pastrami – is peppered to perfection, tender and not too salty. Izzy’s sandwiches are double-stacked with layers of bread and meat. The pastrami-bread ratio is a delicate balance, one bite into too much pastrami and you might feel like you’re sinking your teeth into a salty cow carcass. The Izzy’s version of the pastrami sandwich, with the alternating layers of bread, double-baked fresh every day, offsets the meat’s saltiness.

Although the meat packs a peppery punch, you can choose to add horseradish, hot or sweet mustard, or a Gulden’s brand deli mustard to add an extra kick. We recommend leaving the mustard on the side, however. Slathering too much mustard on the sandwich can overwhelm the delicate flavor of the pastrami.

The pickles – of which they’ve sold more than 6 million, according to the restaurant’s T-shirt – are barreled, instead of jarred, which gives them a fresh crunch and locks in the garlic flavor. Creamy and fresh coleslaw is made in-house, as is potato salad and macaroni salad. Soups are also made fresh daily.

[img57 right]

Again, the service is what really makes the place shine. Waitress Hana Koudelka has been serving at Izzy’s for 40 years, and if you ask her what she likes to eat, she won’t hesitate to detail the merits of Izzy’s brisket, lox and even oatmeal.

Izzy’s is truly the “deli next door,” not only because it’s geographically the closest to Westwood, but also because it’s a dependable, go-to spot for late-night comfort food.

# Canter’s Deli
- “The Institution”
- 419 N. Fairfax Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90036
- Open 24 hours
- Established: 1931

[img70 fullwidth]

Canter’s may have New York flair, but it’s a uniquely L.A. institution. It takes just one look at the breakfast menu (huevos rancheros are listed next to matzo brei) to understand that this is not just another Brooklyn-style deli.

In 1931, New Jersey native Ben Canter and his brothers opened up a delicatessen in Boyle Heights, a mostly Jewish community at the time. Three generations later, Jacqueline Canter co-owns the 24-hour deli at its new location on Fairfax and runs it with her siblings.

The signature sandwiches include the Pastrami Reuben ($14.50), a dense mixture of thinly-sliced smoked beef, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and sweet Russian dressing squeezed between slices of crispy, grilled rye bread.

[img65 fullwidth]

The Canter’s Fairfax, another signature sandwich, is packed with hot corned beef and pastrami on rye bread, served with a side of crunchy cole slaw or creamy potato salad. After eating this sandwich, your jaw aches the way it does after smiling too long for a family photo.

The traditional rye bread, which we recommend rather than the gluten-free option, is made fresh in a bakery above the restaurant. If you’re there at the right time, sometimes you can hear the “whoosh” of the machines as the bread is prepared, according to one Canter’s waitress, Diane Norem. Norem, 55, dined at Canter’s as a child, and she once asked a waitress about the noise. The waitress told her the sound came from the bakers upstairs torturing nosy kids.

For all the talk of the food, it’s really the history of Canter’s that makes this place worth the trip.

“It’s like a home away from home. We’re on a first name basis with a lot of customers,” Canter said. “If they don’t come in, we call them up and make sure they’re okay. It’s like we’re their Jewish mother.”

[img71 fullwidth]

Regular Canter’s customers notice even the minutest changes to service. “You put the mustards in bottles and all of a sudden it’s like, ‘Wait ... the mustards used to be in a jar.’ That took some getting used to,” Norem said.

If you ever grow jaded with some of Los Angeles’ more hipster restaurants, Canter’s is the perfect antidote. Norem puts it best: “People like sameness, and this place never changes.”

# Philippe the Original
- “The Wild Card”
- 1001 N. Alameda St. Los Angeles, CA 90012
- Open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
- Established: 1908

[img66 fullwidth]

[img53 right]

Deli purists will tell you Philippe the Original is no deli. There’s no corned beef and no pastrami. But we’re dubbing Philipe’s the “wild card” because it has some of the essential elements of a deli: hand-crafted sandwiches, a long history of family ownership and nostalgic decor.

Walk through the doors of Philippe’s and you’ll kick up some sawdust on your way in. The sawdust, originally meant to soak up spills on the floor, is one of many touches that helps the restaurant maintain its old-fashioned flavor.

[img58 left]

Instead of pastrami, the mainstay is the Philippe French Dipped Sandwich, a French roll soaked with roast juices and stuffed with your choice of meat – roast beef, roast pork, leg of lamb, turkey or ham.

The roast is a two-day process. The first step involves stewing the meat with celery, onions, carrots, various other vegetables, bay leaves and other spices. The next day, themeat is mixed with garlic salt, then rests in the oven for about three hours.

[img60 right]

We recommend the juicy, tender lamb, carved right off the bone, and paired with the sharp, dry flavor of blue cheese. The beef and swiss cheese is also a classic, but be warned: The beef if fattier than deli-style pastrami. Go for the the double dip (top and bottom), and try the triple dip if you love a soggy sandwich drenched in juices.

The presentation is somewhat drab – your meal comes on gray, disposable cardboard plates – but the magic is in the rich gravy juices.

[img68 fullwidth]

Rumor has it the French gravy dip technique came about by accident. In 1918, restaurant founder Philippe Mathieu dropped a French roll into the roasting pan while serving a police officer. The officer ate the sandwich anyway, and liked it so much, he came back the next day with friends.

# Langer’s
- “The Deli Daddy”
- 704 S. Alvarado St. Los Angeles, CA 90057
- Open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., closed Sundays
- Established: 1947

[img56 right]

It may seem strange to dub Langer’s the“father” of L.A. delis, since it’s certainly not the oldest in town. But Langer’s is a true pop-and-son establishment.

Norm Langer, the current owner, began working at Langer’s alongside his father, Al, in 1962.

[img59 left]

“A deli is a way of life ... it’s a living, breathing entity and you must take care of it,” Langer said after recounting the history of the deli on a sunny Los Angeles afternoon. “It is my child and I raised it.”

If sandwiches were children, the #19 – a pastrami stacked with swiss cheese, cole- slaw and Russian dressing – would be the pride and joy of the family.

Los Angeles Times food critic Jonathan Gold dubbed Langer’s pastrami the best in the United States.

Unlike other deli sandwiches, the #19 doesn’t give you “deli belly,” that piercing stomach pang people commonly experience after pigging out on pastrami.

There are some that would call Langer’s version of pastrami on rye bread sacrilegious. It deviates from the classic meat and bread model and places less importance on mustards. “I don’t carry Grey Poupon (mustard) because I don’t drive a Rolls-Royce,” Langer said with a laugh.

[img63 right]

But the mustard isn’t really necessary when you’ve got creamy coleslaw and Russian dressing to flavor the sandwich. Langer’s Russian dressing is ideal: a rich, tangy sauce that offsets any unintended saltiness or dry flavor of pastrami. The sauce is a well-tuned recipe, with roots tracing back to the kitchens of Langer’s Hungarian and Russian grandmothers.

What really wins you over about the #19, however, is the double-baked bread. After being delivered fresh daily by Fred’s Bakery on Robertson Boulevard, the rye bread is re-baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The result is a moist, soft center surrounded by a crispy, crunchy crust. Al Langer developed the technique as a way to revitalize the bread he ordered from Los Angeles, which often arrived stale via Greyhound bus to Palm Springs, the location of his first deli.

[img67 fullwidth]

“To me, what’s very important is to make you feel like we’re happy you’re here,” said Langer.

As a child, Roderick Tung told his mother that he wanted to be an artist, dentist and conductor. Even as a kid, he wanted to have three jobs.

In college, he pursued the accelerated seven-year medical program at Northwestern University with a voice specialization for his music minor. Even while studying medicine, he entertained the idea of becoming a pop star in Asia.

Today, Tung is an assistant professor of medicine and specializes in cardiology/cardiovascular disease and clinical cardiac electrophysiology at the UCLA Cardiac Arrhythmia Center. But of course, even that isn’t the whole story.

In 2009, staying true to the multifaceted ambitions of his childhood self, he developed TUNG, a self-titled brand of luxury men’s shirts, adding CEO and fashion designer to his formidable catalogue of accomplishments.

[img356 fullwidth]

From moving to Los Angeles for a fellowship at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to traveling to northern Italy to meet with a textile manufacturer who is now his current supplier, Tung is as unafraid as he is ambitious to pursue his passions. prime spoke with Tung about becoming a doctor and a fashion designer, and about choosing not to choose between his two passions.

***

[img353 fullwidth]

prime: Let’s start with the doctor aspect of your career. You clearly have varied interests – what inspired you to pursue medicine?

Roderick Tung: My father was diagnosed with colorectal cancer when I was young. I had to deal with that at a very young age, and it was really one of those situations where I felt that the physicians were really special because they were privy and trained with some knowledge that very few people in society are able to achieve. I felt that it was very empowering, and it helped me appreciate how knowledge is powerful and how health above all things is critical to our lives.

I was always good at science and math, so I followed my strengths. I knew that medicine would be a career that would ultimately be rewarding because of its basic mission, and it was an alignment with my strengths academically.

[img351 fullwidth]

prime: What about fashion? There are a lot of people who like fashion, who appreciate fashion, but very few people choose to pursue it the way you did, especially considering your career path. What inspired you to start your own clothing line when there are many less intensive ways of pursuing an interest in fashion?

RT: I find fashion fascinating at an intellectual level. We all have to wear something every day, because that’s what’s socially acceptable, and we all have a choice in terms of what we wear. What we wear often reflects our moods and our personalities and frequently determines how other people in society interact with us.

Fashion for me was something that not only could fuel an artistic outlet, but it was really using my creative energy to do something that was entrepreneurial. Growing up, my mother was a small-business owner. We opened our own restaurant, and I remember trying to design my mother’s logo for her. I’ve always enjoyed design, and I think that’s why starting this label, for me, was kind of second nature.

[img349 fullwidth]

prime: So it’s been six years since you first established this business. How has TUNG evolved over the years and where do you see it going?

RT: It all started with my obsession with the details in men’s dress shirts and having purchased so many and not feeling like I had the perfect shirt. I was on this quest to come up with an eclectic mixture of all my favorite brands and concepts that I’ve ever seen. The beauty of it is that I have a day job that I am passionate about and this is my hobby. This was me spending money on a hobby that was an investment in myself and a potential new business.

I was basically a one-man show as the sole investor, designer, CEO, marketer and distributor. I hand-delivered my shirts to stores. The highlight of my shirt line so far was in 2011, when I was asked to be the featured men’s designer for Neiman Marcus’ Fashion’s Night Out. Things have never gone to a level that I envisioned, but I’ve realized now that we are limited by 24-hour days, and my medical career has gotten busier and busier.

I haven’t made a new collection in about a year and a half, but I recently went back to Italy and started making new sport jackets and three-piece suits in addition to shirts. My idea now is to try to reinvigorate the brand as more of a custom collection and work with private customers.

[img350 fullwidth]
prime: Fashion and medicine seem to be very different fields to be play in. Do you ever have a difficult time balancing the two?

RT: I think things that really satisfy my soul and my intellectual and creative energy are the constant desire for a clean order, symmetry, perfectionism. It’s the same approach that I have for any medical procedure as I do when I sit down and try to make a great shirt or make a great figure for an academic manuscript.

There is a marriage and there are some unifying themes between both sides. I think that there ways to be creative in medicine as well. I don’t think they are that different. I think fashion as an industry is thought to be relatively anti-academic, and I think medicine as an industry is stereotyped to be absent of creativity and expression.

prime: As you may be aware, UCLA has its own set of stereotypes for the more humanities-oriented North Campus and more science-oriented South Campus. As a doctor and designer, you certainly defy these stereotypes. Have you faced challenges in positioning yourself outside of the traditional expectations of each industry?

RT: One of the things I had hoped to be able to do is to show that those stereotypes are not always true and need not apply to everyone. Everything in life is a spectrum. I think that people need to understand that it is not all or nothing. When I was younger, I thought that everything was black and white. (Now) I realize you have to see where the different ends are and figure out where you fall in.

I had so much fear going into the fashion industry. I didn’t want to tell people I was a doctor. But when they found out I was a physician, they were actually more impressed. People like polymaths, and I think that everyone has a polymath inside them.

[img354 fullwidth]

prime: Many students here at UCLA struggle to balance academic goals with unrelated interests, whether it be through a minor or investing time in other hobby activities. You’ve managed to pursue a career in medicine as well as fashion as a hobby at a level that most people could only dream of. What advice can you give to students who are having difficulty figuring out that balance?

RT: My advice would be to never let go of your passions and never let them go to sleep. We don’t choose our passions. They choose us. That’s what makes each individual different from the next, and that’s what makes life beautiful.

I think we are at our best when we can at least quench our thirsts for our passions from time to time. You’ve been dealt the hand you’ve been dealt for whatever creative energies you have. Students should explore them without fear of being judged for trying to do more than one thing.

prime: Beyond inspiring those interested in medicine or fashion, what do you think students can learn from your story?

RT: One of my favorite figures in history is Leonardo da Vinci. He was an anatomist, a scientist, a philosopher and an artist. And I think there’s something beautiful about that – that it doesn’t need an apology. If you follow your passions, nothing needs to be reconciled because you love it.

I think my story really isn’t about a doctor that does fashion. It is really a story about being true to yourself and harnessing the power of your creative thirst and energy, and going forward and doing things you love to do. It’s more about the human experience and not being afraid of it.","",19,,ARTICLE,7
244,A World Away,world-away,Daily Bruin News Editor Jeong Park on the undocumented student experience,"[img368 fullwidth]

Last May, my grandmother had a stroke. I heard about it three days later, nearly 6,000 miles away, sitting in my dim dorm room, clutching my cell phone as my dad called.

I wanted the first flight to Seoul. All I wanted was to touch her.

But as an undocumented immigrant, I couldn’t. Because I have overstayed my six-month tourist visa by nine years, going to Korea means that I would be banned from applying for a visa to the U.S. for the next 10 years. I would be effectively banned from coming back to the U.S. during that time.

The U.S. was, and is, my promised land. I didn’t expect, however, to lose as much of my life as I have.

In Korea, I was a teacher’s pet in elementary school, always getting high grades on tests. My grandparents bragged about the dozens of certificates I got in fourth grade, commemorating different speech and reading contests I had won. I even ran for vice president of my school, failing but keeping the race competitive even when nobody thought I had a chance.

Then, my classmates’ jealousy set in, and the wheels fell off.

My grandmother saw me cry one morning, dreading going to school because my classmates had splashed water on me and laughed at me the day before.

My mom had always wanted me to study in a foreign country. She wanted me to be in a bigger pond, and even had me try living in another country – Australia – where I stayed with my cousin for a month.

[img370 fullwidth]

But she didn’t know when she should send me to the foreign country. After all, changing virtually everything around me was a risky decision.

But as soon as my mom heard that I cried, she had enough. She booked a flight to Los Angeles for herself and me.

When we arrived at the Los Angeles International Airport, my mom told me to tell the customs officer that I came to travel and see the Grand Canyon.

“Don’t speak English,” my mom told me. “Pretend like you don’t know what’s going on.”

I did see the Grand Canyon, but my mom also sent me to a boarding school in Van Nuys that has since closed down. What was meant to be a six-month stay with my visitor’s visa has turned into a nine-year stop (and counting).

Through my nine years in America, I went to school in four different cities and called three strangers whom I lived with my “uncles” just so I didn't have to explain who they were.

I learned to speak English. I enrolled at UCLA, studied political science and became an assistant news editor for the the Daily Bruin. Long gone is the kid who had water poured on him at school – now, I have dozens of friends who genuinely like me.

Legally, conditions for undocumented immigrants have improved since I arrived here.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals has prevented hundreds of thousands from being deported and provided them with work permits (for what it’s worth, I’m still seeking one). Because of the newly passed Assembly Bill 60, many undocumented immigrants can obtain drivers' licenses in California. I don't have to pay tuition because the California Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act made me eligible for a Cal Grant.

Because of efforts from activists who have come out with their status, being undocumented is not as stigmatized as it was when I came to this country.

I have succeeded.

I have achieved the American dream.

These policies and activism have enabled me to come and study at UCLA with relative ease. I have become that ""dreamer"" whom people can point to.

Yet, I ask if that matters.

What is the point of the American dream when your family is 6,000 miles away? What is the point of the American dream when you can’t see your grandparents? What is the point of the American dream when you feel desperately alone?

No policy can make me forget the last nine birthdays I have spent (and the several more I will spend) without my parents.

No policy can bring back the time when my grandfather and I sang Korean folk tunes as we climbed our neighborhood mountain. No policy can restore the memory of spending Chinese New Year – or Seol-Nal – with my cousins and extended family.

I see my mom about twice a year. She is the only family member who can afford to come. For the first couple of years of my stay here, I would cry a night and a day after she left. She would kiss me softly on my cheeks.

Now, the nine-year stay has made me feel detached. I still love it when my mom visits. I still want her to be around, but it isn’t the same. What is point of success if you don’t have anyone to share it with?

I can drive. I can work. But I can’t be with those who love me and whom I love.

Sure, you can tell me that I am just whining, that I should go back to my country, that I have no business being here. I’m an ""illegal,"" after all.

But then, what is the point of the last nine years I spent alone?

[img369 fullwidth]

If I go back, everything I learned and everyone I befriended in the U.S. would essentially be wiped out of my life. I would spend the rest of my life in a country whose people I’m familiar with, but whose customs and culture I’m not. I've heard about them through Korean television and movies, but hearing is different than actually experiencing them.

I have run so far, and roads running the other way have been blocked off.

It’s not that I regret coming here. My mom had me run away from my problems in Korea, and frankly, it worked out well.

Perhaps I’m being too greedy in trying to return to Korea to see my family and also stay in the U.S. to work. But fundamentally, it shouldn’t be an either-or question.

As of now, I’m stuck in a dilemma, trying to deal with the status quo as best as I can.

When I turned 20 last May, when I first heard about my grandmother’s stroke, I wrote this on my blog: “I believe my grandparents will stay strong, but that’s no excuse for not seeing them. ... Hopefully I get to see my grandparents soon, whatever that way may be. I mean, writing this when I get to 21 sounds just, just so depressing.”

Yet, I have just turned 21, with seemingly nothing for me ahead.

My father called me a few weeks ago on my grandmother’s birthday. He passed his phone to my grandmother.

“I lived so long, and I have inconvenienced so many people because of me,” my grandmother told me, saying how her illness has made my grandfather struggle.

I told her that’s not true, that everyone appreciates how she has recovered. But there is only so much emotion, so many things I can tell her over the phone, speaking 6,000 miles away from her house.

If only I could say I love her, to her, with her.","",7,,ARTICLE,8
245,Sweet and Spicy: Summer food indulgences in Los Angeles,sweet-and-spicy,"Should you go out for dinner or for dessert? We say both. And in the spirit of summer, here are our recommendations for some sugar and spice. ","We know it’s sometimes hard to decide what to eat on a Friday night and, over the course of the year, we’ve learned it’s just as hard to decide what we want to review for you. In the spirit of summer indulgence, we at prime decided to give you both: sweet and spicy.

# ""The Sweet Nostalgic""
**Milk Jar Cookies** | 5466 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036

[img163 right]

Located a few blocks from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevard, this charming little cookie bakery is a simple bus ride away. Immediately visible is its white, vintage-country aesthetic, which makes you feel quite at home. A chandelier of its namesake milk jars hangs from the ceiling and music from the ‘50s plays as customers walk up to the counter and make their selections.
The price of a cookie ($3) might seem steep, but trust us, they are filling. Banana Split, one of the most popular cookies, has a strawberry baked into the cookie and tastes a lot like sweet banana bread with butterscotch chips. Chocolate Pecan Caramel, although rich and moist, is strong enough to hold together despite a thick, gooey caramel center. The pecans add a nice crunch, too. Next time we’ll try White Chocolate Raspberry and Rocky Road.

[img164 fullwidth]

Beverages include, but are not limited to, mini or large jars of milk from local dairies and iced mochas made with Los Angeles-roasted coffee served in mason jars. As they say at Milk Jar, “Life’s short, eat cookies.”

[img165 fullwidth]

# ""The Cozy Cafe""
**Churros Calientes** | 11521 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90025

[img167 right]

If you don’t know it’s there, it’s easy to miss this little shop on your way into Santa Monica. Open on the weekends and in the evenings on weekdays, Churros Calientes is the perfect spot for dessert when you’re craving something a bit different. Just a few blocks west of Sawtelle Boulevard, forget the boba for an evening and splurge on churros – you won’t regret it.

Its signature, churros con chocolate ($7) gives you six thin churros sprinkled with sugar (no cinnamon) and a teacup of thick, Spanish-style hot chocolate for dipping and sipping. Each bite starts with a quick crisp followed by a warm, light dough on the inside.

[img168 left]

If you don’t love chocolate, we recommend you try the basic churros calientes option ($4) or a churros grande ($5). With each churros grande you can pick a filling and a topping — cream cheese filling with guava drizzling is one of their most popular. The warm cream cheese is sweet but not overwhelming and has a consistency more similar to sour cream. The guava on top is just enough to get the sweet, strong fruity taste without getting the churro soggy.

If you have a big group and are worried about seating (intimate yes, but space can get a bit tight), churros are also available to go.

[img166 fullwidth]

# ""The Mom and Pop Shop with a Kick""
**Beverly Soon Tofu Restaurant** | 2717 W. Olympic Blvd. Ste. 108, Los Angeles, CA 90006

[img161 fullwidth]

The siren call of delicious all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue is difficult to ignore when you are in Koreatown, but when you do it pays off.

Beverly Soon Tofu Restaurant, located in a little strip mall on a corner, is some of the best tofu soup we’ve ever had. Inside the small restaurant, guests sit on wooden benches at tables that look like they were carved from a tree.

For $8.99 you can choose between 10 soft tofu soups cooked plain, mild, medium or spicy. We tried the spicy combination with beef, oyster and baby clam. The spice level wasn’t too intense for being their hottest, but it did provide a strong, flavorful kick. If you like spicy food that burns your mouth, you likely won’t find it here but you’ll still be wanting water.

[img162 fullwidth]

Also highly recommended are the combinations with large portions, like a full-size bowl of bibimbap or a whole spicy barbecue squid ($16.99). The squid, which comes sizzling on a skillet, has a more obvious heat factor. Cooked in spicy red sauce, you can taste the peppers.

Every meal comes with standard side dishes (banchan) and ice-cold barley tea. The barley flavor is strong, so you might want to ask for water if it’s not to your taste.

# ""The Friendly Italian""
**Fritto Misto Italian Café** | 601 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90407

[img169 right]

A welcoming yellow wall, hand-painted plates and tables made of wine crates greet you when you enter, giving off a warmhearted Italian feel.

Start with the fried pillows. The warm, creamy herb ricotta inside complements the chewiness of the dough — dip them in pineapple cocktail sauce and enjoy.

We were impressed to see no less than seven pastas labeled with either “hot” or “spicy” on the menu, so we decided to try the Atomic Pasta. Served with two well-spiced chicken breasts on linguini and a bed of various peppers with a chipotle-like sauce, this pasta uses its spice for a purpose, not just raw heat. Consider it pasta with a bit of pep. We should also add that the portions are huge and, at $15.25, this was one of the more expensive items on the overall affordable menu.

[img171 fullwidth]

There’s also the option to create your own pasta. Curious, with the guidance of our waitress, we tried our luck with black and white spaghettini, shrimp and artichoke hearts with chipotle sauce. Colored black by squid ink, the spaghettini had a slightly tougher texture than standard pasta and went well with the shrimp and tender artichoke hearts.

If you get a chance, try the flourless cake. Served with a whopping dollop of thick whipped cream, this dense chocolate cake is best shared. The food was great but the service really set this little Italian restaurant apart.

247,A perfect day in LA: Exploring Los Feliz,perfect-day-la-exploring-los-feliz,"Lifelong Angeleno Alexandra Tashman takes us out for a quirky day in Los Feliz, a neighborhood she says you won’t want to overlook.","[youtube]http://youtu.be/pcAgWjOSnr4[/youtube]

Of all the neighborhoods in Los Angeles, Los Feliz is my favorite. It is best known as the equally as hipster but somewhat more gentrified next-door neighbor of the ever-trendy Silver Lake, and I discovered the area shortly after learning to drive. It was love at first sight.

Charming Spanish-style bungalows from the 1920s line the blocks up until the business district, which is chock full of funky vintage stores, used vinyl shops, old brick buildings and food options from Greek to Brazilian.

The neighborhood is nestled directly at the base of Griffith Park (the largest municipal park in the country – take that New York), and the famed Griffith Observatory can be seen easily from the streets.

But it’s not just the food, shopping or proximity to interesting places that make Los Feliz unique. The energy is young and creative, and it’s clear that people from all over the city flock there for the neighborhood’s charm and relaxed vibe. There are multiple bookstores, record stores, arts and crafts stores – it’s intellectual and funky at the same time, in a way that Venice can’t quite match. Los Feliz is like the anti-Brentwood: There’s not a Range Rover soccer mom for miles.

As a native Angeleno, I like to consider myself somewhat of an expert on this city’s ins and outs. You can’t learn this city in a day or even a year. But if you have a free afternoon to spend exploring anywhere across town, make it Los Feliz. You won’t be sorry.

***

On the east side of North Vermont Avenue, just south of Franklin Avenue, there’s an unusual patch of sidewalk.

Imbedded in the concrete are a random assortment of keys, door locks, a fork, a knife and an imprint of where a spoon used to be. In the middle, the number “62” has been scrawled into the cement by hand.

The number isn’t random, of course. It’s referencing the eclectic diner not even 3 feet away: Fred 62.

Colloquially known as Fred’s, you can’t miss it as you walk into the heart of Los Feliz – the restaurant is painted a vibrant green with garish orange awnings.

[img141 fullwidth]

Inside, a somewhat less neon – though no less eccentric – world awaits. Retro booths and a classic diner countertop are nestled comfortably beneath funky ‘60s light fixtures. There’s even a window seat where patrons can sit on cushions and look out at passersby while chowing down on onion rings.

Open 24 hours a day, seven days a week since 1997, Fred’s is the stalwart companion of 3 a.m. diners and 2 p.m. brunchers. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served round the clock.

The food is good but also cheap, which makes it dangerous. I have, on more than one occasion, ordered french toast, fries and mac ‘n cheese in a single sitting.

The food is funny too. Breakfast sandwiches have names like “The Sammy Davis Jr.” (smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, cream cheese and hash browns, $12) and “The Berkeley” (goat cheese, avocado, scrambled eggs and hash browns, $9), while dinner specials include “The Partridge Family” (pan-fried chicken with mashed potatoes and a mini waffle, $16) and “The Lisa Simpson” (a tajine tofu scramble with couscous, $13).

Scattered across the walls in Fred’s are a number of framed paintings, almost of all of which were done by notable Angeleno artist and set designer Wayne White of “Pee-wee’s Playhouse” fame. The paintings are landscapes with giant phrases painted over them in block lettering.

Even at 2 p.m., people around me were ordering breakfast. An elderly couple at a nearby table was grilling the waiter on what exactly “Eggs in the Hole” ($9) is – as it turns out, it’s a piece of toast with the center cut out and an egg cooked inside.

***

Directly next door to Fred’s is the paragon of quirky stores, Popkiller Dept.

A small storefront jam-packed with merchandise, it houses a wide array of vintage clothes and cute jewelry. I once managed to snag a Pope John Paul II crop top there as a Christmas gift for a friend.

But among the vintage lie gag gifts – funny random trinkets and objects that no one really needs, but are amusing to have just the same. Purses shaped like hamburgers, pasta shaped like breasts, a piece of plastic you put in with your toast that makes an imprint of Jesus – you name it, Popkiller has it. They also have an unusually wide array of plastic animal head masks.

[img140 fullwidth]

Down the block is the Los Feliz 3 Cinemas, which has been showing movies daily since 1934. It has a beautiful vintage neon marquee and a giant mural of famous actors on the side. The theaters are intimate and charming, and when I saw “Slumdog Millionaire” there I cried so hysterically that two employees heard me from outside and came in to make sure I was okay (seriously).

But past the cinema lies the neighborhood’s greatest gem. As one of the last independent bookstores in the city, Skylight Books is a sight for sore eyes.

[img143 right]

Opened in 1996, in what was even then a declining climate for small bookstores, Skylight Books is a delightful relic. It has a homeyness that neither Barnes & Noble nor Amazon can recreate.

The bookshelves are filled with current bestsellers and classics, but there’s a special section devoted to LGBT and feminist literature, as well as a whole area for books about Los Angeles. In the midst of shelves and shelves of books is a live tree growing in the middle of the store near the eponymous skylight.

The tree, which has been growing since the store opened, was the brainchild of one of the original partners, who insisted on having a special circular bench built around its base so that customers could sit and enjoy the atmosphere, said Kerry Slattery, the general manager and co-owner.

[img142 fullwidth]

“A lot of people, even though they’ve been in the store, don’t register that there’s a live tree in the middle,” Slattery added.

But no visit to Skylight Books would be complete without meeting the bookstore cat. Known as Franny, the adorable tabby is actually the second cat to call the store home, Slattery said. She even has an Instagram (@frannyskylight), where you can catch glimpses of the bookstore from her point of view.

About a five-minute walk away (or a two-minute drive if you’re as lazy as I am), is Hillhurst Avenue, which boasts a number of lovely restaurants and shops. The street was even the site of Dumb Starbucks, the parody store that was open briefly earlier this year.

On the west side of the street, just north of Franklin Avenue, is Alcove Café and Bakery.

The restaurant is cozy and inviting, with a red brick exterior and trendy but tasteful indoor style. However, it’s the charming patio that makes the experience worth it – whether you sit on the front patio or the side, both are littered with greenery and eclectic furniture.

Although it serves breakfast, lunch and dinner (all of which are delicious), it’s the baked goods and beverages that keep you coming back. Any of the chocolate cakes are outrageously rich, though I decided to sample the fresh fruit tart and a chai latte this time.

***

The biggest challenge in Los Feliz is not the distance from campus, but rather the parking. Here are my secrets:

When parking on North Vermont Avenue, there is a public metered city lot on the side street directly next to Fred 62 (Russell Avenue). That’s your best bet, though there is street parking on the residential streets nearby. Be careful though, the signs are tricky and parking enforcement lies in wait. On Hillhurst Avenue, you can splurge for valet at Alcove Café and Bakery ($5), or go north a block and park in the Albertsons lot next to The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Do not park in any of the bank lots, because they’re eager to tow, even after hours. Otherwise, any sort of metered parking will do.","",1,,ARTICLE,5
248,DIY: How to make mozzarella in your own kitchen,diy-making-mozzarella,With only a handful of ingredients and a little bit of confidence you can make our most ambitious and delicious recipe of the year – mozzarella.,"[img145 fullwidth]

## Tips from my kitchen to yours

- You can find rennet and citric acid powder at Whole Foods Market for $13.
- Milk: Stay away from ultra high temperature (UHT) pasteurized milk. This method of pasteurization denatures the proteins in the milk, preventing them from being able to fully solidify into curds. Whole milk will produce a very rich, soft mozzarella. One percent will make a harder, more string cheese-like cheese. Avoid fat-free milk, as this will make the cheese too rubbery. Raw milk is the best option, though it's typically hard to find.

# Ingredients

- 1 ½ teaspoons of citric acid powder
- ¼ teaspoon liquid vegetable rennet combined with 1 cup water
- 1 gallon of milk: whole, 1 percent or 2 percent, not UHT pasteurized
- 1 teaspoon salt

# In your kitchen

- Large sauce pot
- Slotted spoon (preferably metal)
- Cooking thermometer (ideally with a probe)

[img146 fullwidth]


1. Sprinkle the citric acid powder (after crushing the tablets) into a cool, large stockpot. Pour ¼ cup water over it and stir to dissolve.

2. Pour the milk into the citric acid solution and stir to combine. [img147 fullwidth]

3. Put the pot over medium-low heat and heat it to 90 degrees (use an instant-read thermometer). You may notice the milk beginning to curdle – this is a good thing.

4. When the milk reaches 90 degrees, remove the pan from the burner and pour in the rennet mixed with water.

5. Stir the mixture with a gentle, circular up-and-down motion for about 30 seconds, then use the spoon to stop the motion of the milk

6. Place the lid on the pot and leave it for five minutes. After five minutes, the mixture should resemble a very soft custard.

7. With a knife long enough to reach the bottom of the pot, cut the curd into a 1-inch checkerboard pattern, making lines across, then lines perpendicularly.

8. Return the pot to the burner over medium heat and stir it gently until the temperature of the whey (the liquid that separates from the curd) reaches 105 degrees.

9. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the curd to a colander placed over a bowl.

10. Slowly spin around the colander to allow the whey to drain from the curd.

11. Remove the curd and gently squeeze it a few times to drain away excess whey.

12. Transfer the curd to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it on high for one minute.

13. Remove the bowl from the microwave and pour off as much whey as you can. You can preserve all the excess whey and use it to make bread or add it to beverages to make them higher in protein.

14. Press the curd together with your hands and again drain away the whey that comes out.

15. Microwave the curd again on high for 35 seconds, then press it together to drain more whey.

16. Knead and stretch the curd a bit to drain more whey, then microwave it one last time for 35 seconds. [img148 fullwidth]

17. Knead in the salt and roll it under itself until it forms a neat ball. Then place the ball into an ice water bath and let it rest there until cool. [img149 fullwidth]

278,prime City Guide: West Hollywood,prime-winter-cityguideweho,"prime has the best tips and tricks for navigating food, shopping, and entertainment in West Hollywood","[img325 fullwidth]

West Hollywood is an enclave all its own.

The colorful neighborhood is nestled comfortably between the ultra-affluent Beverly Hills and Tinseltown itself, Hollywood. In many ways, WeHo – as it’s affectionately called – is a mix of its surroundings. The Beverly Hills glamour manifests in the trendy boutiques and eateries lining Melrose Avenue, blending seamlessly into the wild nightlife of the Sunset Strip and the sex shops along Santa Monica Boulevard.

And while much of what makes WeHo fun and exciting is priced well outside of a student budget – a night’s worth of dinner and drinks at Chateau Marmont is practically the same price as a quarter’s worth of books – the city hosts a wide range of cheap eats, fun shops and inexpensive activities.

Moreover as Los Angeles’ primary lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender enclave and the heart of the rock music scene from the 1960s onward, WeHo’s broader cultural significance cannot be understated. Where else could you find some of the most storied music venues in history – like the Troubadour – mere doors away from some of the most important LGBT cultural landmarks and educational centers?

But finding the more accessible parts of WeHo takes research, skill and a little bit of luck. Fortunately, prime has you covered – we’ve got the best spots, shops and eats for your buck. Spend a weekend immersing yourself in the different elements that make West Hollywood weird, charming and exciting.

***
## Bite in
***

[img336 fullwidth]

No matter what part of WeHo you find yourself in, there’s always something good to eat.

Start off your day at Alfred Coffee and Kitchen, located on the tiny offshoot of Melrose Place. Inside the immaculately decorated hipster haven, you’ll find an otherworldly selection of coffee, tea, pastries and even pressed juice. It’s an ideal spot for an Instagram photo or a morning of celebrity watching.

Alfred exclusively brews connoisseur-favorite Stumptown Coffee Roasters coffee, and each drink is handcrafted to your specifications. Though perhaps best known for the “Alfred Cone” – a shot of espresso inside of a miniature ice cream cone with a chocolate rim – Alfred also has top-class pastries, with a lemon poppy-seed muffin coming in as the understated fan favorite.

Down the street, you’ll find the cheapest and most elite lunch spot in the city: ink.sack.

A sandwich shop with a school lunch theme (it’s named after sack lunches), the menu takes the best of high cuisine and slaps it on some bread.

[img329 fullwidth]

Don’t let the weird name deceive you. Owned by Michael Voltaggio, the ""Top Chef"" winner who was heralded as one of Food and Wine’s best new chefs of 2013 (a prestigious industry honor), ink.sack is a cheaper way to enjoy some of the finest flavors that his flagship restaurant, ink., located next door, has to offer.

Crowd-pleasers include Voltaggio’s take on the classic Vietnamese banh mi (pork shoulder, bacon, chicharrónes, pickled vegetables, onion spread, $6), the ""cuban"" (barbecue pork, ham, swiss, pickles, mustard, mayo, $6) and the ""cold fried chicken"" (house-made ranch cheese, Gindo's Spice of Life $5). Add a side of house-made salt and pepper chips ($3), and get ready to enjoy highbrow taste in a lowbrow format.


If you’re looking to get your dessert fix, there’s no need to look any further than next door. The neighboring storefront of ink.sack houses an L.A. legend: Sweet Lady Jane.

Named the best patisserie in the world by National Geographic, this cake-making powerhouse is beloved by celebrities from Oprah Winfrey to Ellen DeGeneres (whose wedding cake Sweet Lady Jane made). The shop's slices of cake are gigantic, so they’re worth the price. Split a piece of the famous triple berry shortcake with a friend, or try out the seven-layer mocha cake.

[img327 fullwidth]

Slightly north, on historic Santa Monica Boulevard, you’ll find more traditional grub.

kitchen24, named for the fact it’s open 24 hours a day, is a brunch classic, serving up the best breakfast potatoes – slathered in garlic and onions – in the entire city. While the line on weekends can often seem insurmountable (it can take upward of an hour, so come before you’re hungry), drop by during the week to take advantage of kitchen24's happy hour. It runs from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday.

Down the block, you’ll find a cultural landmark that’s good for a bite – Hamburger Mary’s Bar and Grille.

Sure, the hamburgers are good (with a name like that, they have to be), but Hamburger Mary’s is more than just a place to eat. An LGBT community icon, Hamburger Mary's has playful decor and stellar service that set the stage for a weekly event unlike any other: drag queen bingo.

[img328 fullwidth]

Drop by to play bingo on a Wednesday night, grab a burger and chat with the restaurant’s infamous drag queen hostesses, who run the bingo show.

***
## Shop around
***

[img332 fullwidth]

While most of the shopping in WeHo tends to be of the expensive, designer variety, there are plenty of cool places to go where you can afford to do more than just window shop. Take Kitson, for example. The celebrity-favorite boutique hosts more than its fair share of overpriced tracksuits and the like, but its knickknacks actually run fairly cheap, usually falling in the $20 or less range. Cool jewelry, home decor, books and more can be found at Kitson's flagship location in the heart of WeHo. The store’s bright, open-floor plan makes it easy to wander for ages, picking through the piles and piles of random, cool goods.

It’s a great place to stop by for a last-minute birthday gift too (their “nice Jewish guys” calendar is always a crowd-pleaser).

Up on the Sunset Strip, you’ll find Book Soup. This giant bookstore crams in everything from coffee-table books on French decor to mystery novels to leather-bound copies of Marcel Proust. Take a half hour and get lost among the aisles.

[img337 fullwidth]

But what makes Book Soup unique among the few remaining independent L.A. bookstores is its author events. Several nights a week, Book Soup features a different up-and-coming author for a reading and signing. Drop in to support the burgeoning local writing scene and discover someone new.

***
## Entertain yourself
***

Sure, much of the entertainment in WeHo is crowded into the Sunset Strip, where you’ll mostly find bars and clubs, or concerts with ticket prices that you can only dream of affording. But even if you can’t afford the price tag to go inside, storied rock venues like The Roxy Theatre or Whisky a Go Go can be fun to just look at and soak in the rock ‘n' roll history.

[img330 fullwidth]

If you’re looking for evening entertainment without breaking the bank, look no further than The Comedy Store. Most shows run at $20, but you’ll find big-ticket names playing almost every night. Louis C.K. just filmed his most recent comedy special there.

For more daytime fun, the Museum of Contemporary Art at the Pacific Design Center is a good place to start. Not only are the rotating exhibits always amazing, but entrance is free. The fashion exhibit currently on display is as weird as it is enthralling. Not to mention, this lesser-known outpost of MOCA is often quieter, and the architecture of the Pacific Design Center alone is enough to warrant a visit.

***

Although West Hollywood boasts plenty of other fun things to do, from concerts to nightlife and bars, the city’s true heart lies in its people. From the LGBT landmarks that dot the streets to the small Russian bakeries crammed into tiny storefronts, the city’s history continues to be shaped by the communities that call it home.

Walk around and explore.

253,Glassware for Repair: Family business maintains art of glassblowing,glassware-repair-family-business-maintains-art-glassblowing,Jeff Tait is a glassblower who comes to UCLA about once a month to pick up and repair broken glassware from the chemistry department and around campus. ,"At the end of a corridor on the ground floor of Young Hall is Room 1294. If you peer through the bent, yellowing plastic shades and you’re lucky, you may see a man.

[img77 right]

His name is Jeff Tait. He is likely bent over a worktable that is shoved against a wall of the small anteroom leading into the electronics shop. He’ll be sketching a large spherical glass apparatus on a yellow pad of lined paper.

Tait is not always there – he comes in about once a month on no regular schedule. “It’s kind of a word-of-mouth type thing,” Tait said. “People ask around and find (me).”

Since 2002, Tait, CEO and head glassblower for T&G Scientific Glass Fabrication, Inc., has been repairing, designing and fabricating custom and standard glassware for the UCLA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.

Tait, who has been blowing glass for 42 years, may not have a background in chemistry, but he makes up for it in years of experience, having gradually picked up the language of chemistry from all of the projects he has worked on.

Craig Merlic, associate professor in the chemistry and biochemistry department, is the man who found Tait. Over the past 24 years, Merlic has witnessed changes within the department regarding glassblowing.

Before Tait, UCLA had three full-time, on-campus glassblowers. That was in the 1970s. By the 1980s, that number had dropped to two, and in the 1990s there was only one left, Merlic said. By 2002, UCLA had closed the on-campus glass shop where these glassblowers had worked and, in that same year, hired Tait to take care of UCLA’s glassware needs.

# The workshop

After picking up boxes of broken glass and consulting with various researchers at UCLA, Tait takes the materials to his workshop in Laguna Hills, where he will make the necessary repairs.

An Airstream Land Yacht travel trailer is parked inside the garage door that serves as the only major natural light source in the otherwise windowless warehouse. There’s a forklift in front of the trailer, and in the 20-foot space behind them are three sand buggies, a lawn mower, a motorcycle and hundreds of boxes either piled on the floor or stacked on shelving that extends to the ceiling.

To the left of these “ongoing projects” are the machines relevant to the glassblowing trade. Ovens that reach roughly 1,020 degrees Fahrenheit and two lathes that hold and spin glass while fire melts the pieces together are just some of the components necessary to get the job done.

This is where broken glassware gets its second chance at life.

Sitting at one of the lathes, Tait works to seal a neck onto a flask. Wearing square, black glasses and holding a flame torch, he directs a bright orange fireball at the point he wants to seal.

[img81 fullwidth]

The fireball engulfs a good portion of the neck he’s trying to attach to the flask, making it hard to tell what the glass looks like at all. The trick is the eyewear. The specialized lenses cause the distracting fireball, called a sodium flare, to become almost invisible to Tait. Instead, all he sees is the true shape of the glass.

[img79 fullwidth]

He finishes the piece, removing it from the lathe with his bare hands and placing it in the oven.

“It doesn’t hurt, but you dance a little,” Tait said, rubbing his fingers together.

The carpet beneath him is sprinkled with black burn marks.

There is a distinction that researchers who work with glassware make before they approach Tait: whether an object can be thrown away or not.

It all comes down to the cost of a broken object. A glass quartz tube with the capacity to withstand high temperatures could cost upward of $400 to replace but might be cheaper to repair. An equivalent tube made of different material without that tolerance for heat might cost $50 to $60 to replace, Tait said. At that price, some might choose to buy a new tube.

The industry has become mechanized, he said. Rather than repair glass, oftentimes it’s less costly to throw it away. That means specialty glasswork, like the customization T&G offers, is more of a niche market, and work often depends on how cost-effective the company is for a customer.

Tait’s visits to UCLA are so irregular that some, like Ryan Chung, a third-year chemistry student, have turned to other options. Chung, who was part of a synthetic inorganic research group, said that inexpensive glass that was broken in the lab was just thrown away. Anything more expensive and worthy of repair was outsourced to shops in Pasadena.

# A family business

[img80 right]

“Dad, how old are you?” shouts Wesley Tait, 34, son of Jeff Tait and vice president in charge of production at T&G. He throws a ball for his dog Mookie, who scrambles away to retrieve it in the cluttered workshop.

There’s a pause before the older Tait, who is working on another piece at the glass lathe, replies.

“Too old.”

Jeff Tait is 59.

After graduating high school, he attended Orange Coast College for about six months before dropping out.

In 1972, he ended up in the warehouse of a now-out-of-business glass manufacturing company near Costa Mesa. He worked there, moving up in the ranks, until 1985, when he started T&G with a friend.

The company is now family-owned – his wife, son and daughter work there together. As for his clients, he remembers most, if not all, as well as the work he did for them. He said he’s been in business with most of his clients since he opened his shop 25 years ago. He still prefers delivering glass by hand because the packaging is easier and he gets to see his customers, he said. He calls these trips his “Tour de California.”

[img78 left]

Leaning against the Airstream, Jeff Tait recounts a story of a client in Las Vegas who called one day at 7 a.m. requesting at least a dozen 14-foot-long probes by the next day to be used for environmental testing.

“It was just a matter of sealing tubes,” Jeff Tait said.

They were on the road to Las Vegas by 4 p.m. that day. The tubes stretched from the dashboard of his truck to 3 or 4 feet out the back, with the bike rack acting as support.

After telling his story, Jeff Tait walks away to get more work done, while Wesley Tait holds a ball for Mookie and talks about a day in the life at the workshop.

His mom hasn’t been around lately, so the workshop is messier than usual, he said, laughing. And his sister, who deals with the finances, has been out on maternity leave. Lately, it has just been his dad and him, working side by side on different projects for hours each day.

The best part of it all?

He first consults his companion for feedback: “What do you think, Mookie?” Then he throws a ball toward a file cabinet.

“It’s always changing,” he said. “I could do one part 100 times and every time it would seal differently.”","",5,,ARTICLE,4
254,"Back in the Ranks: A soldier finds a new home, new loyalties in LA",back-ranks-soldier-finds-new-home-new-loyalties-la,"Oliver Kay, a military intelligence officer, graduated from UCLA in September. He led a platoon of 30 men for the British Army in Iraq.","[img83 fullwidth]

Colored flags mark six continents and obscure most of Europe on the large canvas map that overlooks the living room of a neat two-bedroom apartment just more than two miles from the UCLA campus.

After four years as an officer in the British Army, Oliver Kay ventured to a new city, Los Angeles, to get his education. He graduated with recognition for excellence in service from UCLA in September, and commissioned as a military intelligence officer, this time under a different flag.

Now a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Kay began his military career anew as a cadet in UCLA’s U.S. Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.

[img85 left]

“I just wanted to serve my country,” Kay said, after pointing out the area of the South China Sea where his grandfather – his inspiration for joining the military – served.“It sounds very cheesy, but to me, it’s very deep, I actually really mean it.”

Kay, now 32, still remembers his first day in Iraq in 2008. The large doors of the carrier plane opened, a sandy desert lay ahead of him, and he began his tour with a platoon of British soldiers who would soon become a group he would call his family.

“I remember getting out of the Hercules, as soon as the door dropped down and the smell just wafted in, a distinctive heat just hit me.”

The unfamiliarity of the territory coupled with the uneasiness of not knowing what lay beyond the wire fencing surrounding their base could have made Kay yearn for home. But he relished the opportunity and made the best of his circumstances.

Today, Kay remembers the day he handed his platoon of 30 men over to the commander who took his place as one of the most difficult moments in his life.

“It was more difficult than saying goodbye to my family, because I had been a soldier with them for two years.

I knew them better than I knew my sisters.”

***

In 2009, Kay’s then-wife asked him to move to Los Angeles from England. She missed her homeland and wanted to return, promising she would help him find an Arabic program and enroll at a university to finally earn his undergraduate degree.

Together they moved to Los Angeles and he began studying at California State University, Northridge. After one year, Kay transferred to UCLA, where he studied African and Middle Eastern studies.

With four years of service as an officer in the British Army, Kay hoped to return to the armed services. As a student at UCLA, this meant enrolling as a cadet in the ROTC program.

The transition from platoon commander to cadet was a rocky one at first. Despite his previous and extensive military experience, Kay had to start from the bottom in the U.S. Army. Every nation has different training requirements, and career experience in a foreign military doesn’t transfer over as it might for other careers.

Entering college ROTC programs with previous U.S. military experience isn’t unheard of. Typically, an enlisted member of the military goes to college and joins the ROTC with the hope of rejoining the military as a commissioned officer after graduation.

But entering the training program with foreign military experience is less common.

“Basic training was a very frustrating experience. I went from being second in command to being a private,” Kay said.

[img82 right]

His peers were no longer experienced war veterans. His fellow cadets mostly consisted of teenage college students just beginning to learn military skills and traditions. Students in the program, often fresh from high school, ranked higher than him in the program and had never seen active duty.

“You learn more in two months of operations than two years of training,” he said.

Despite initial frustrations, Kay’s months on tour in Iraq proved useful for his fellow cadets when the same tactics he learned became new lessons in training exercises on campus.

“He shared from his experiences of leadership,” said Lt. Col. Michael McDermott, a professor and chair of the UCLA Department of Military Science, which is synonymous with the ROTC program. McDermott, who joined the department last summer, was impressed by Kay’s gregarious and engaging personality, which helped other cadets understand leadership as a partnership.

During Kay’s time at UCLA, ROTC students learned tactical skills on the grassy fields at Sunset Canyon Recreation Center every Thursday. On one occasion, Kay helped teach cadets to clear buildings, a skill he developed and used during his tour in Iraq.

Most of the training for warfare in Iraq involves fighting in cities, Kay said. To prepare soldiers for these conditions, the military teaches Military Operations in Urban Terrain, a strategy that allows soldiers to clear potentially dangerous buildings.

In populous urban neighborhoods, enemy combatants are rarely in the open, but rather hidden in buildings, out of sight, making it important for soldiers to effectively clear a building for safe passage.

“Like a baby, you learn to crawl, then walk, run, sprint,” Kay said. “It’s the same in the military.”

He helped them learn slowly, to first clear one room, then two. Next they would practice what it would be like to clear a building with two rooms and an upper story. Kay said opportunities to act as both pupil and informal instructor made working his way up from the bottom less discouraging.

Buildings were an obstacle Kay was familiar with, but academic life provided a new challenge.

Victoria Sanelli, the department manager for UCLA’s military science department, helped Kay adjust to the ROTC program and life at UCLA. Subjects like mathematics, which weren’t Kay’s strong suit, posed a challenge, Sanelli said.

“He has really worked so hard to come to UCLA, graduate and commission,” Sanelli said. “There were a lot of things that would have been easy to lose conviction over, but he kept trying and didn’t give up.”

***

A photo of Kay’s company in the British Army is tacked to a wall above his bed. On the back, the phrase “Cheers Rambo, it’s been emotional,” was scrawled by fellow soldier Prince Harry of Wales.

Nearby, on a wooden table, stands a tall, white candle, which the British Army gave to him when he first deployed to Iraq. The candle will sit on his bedside table until it is burned at his funeral.

“A lot of civilians don’t understand what it’s like when you’re actually in war,” he said. “And at the same time, soldiers shouldn’t expect them to. What I personally felt as a veteran, was (that) it just was nice to come back and just to talk to people.”

[img84 right]

But among all his sentimental belongings, the quiet fish tank swimming with bright red and blue cardinal tetra stands out.

“I find them really relaxing and sometimes I’ll just sit here with a cup of tea for ages. And I’ll just watch my fish.”

Kay was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his service in Iraq. When he first returned, he said he would feel sad. When he would feel overwhelmed, Kay would take a quiet moment to think about his fish or go for a run on the beach.

During the three years he attended UCLA, Kay ran the L.A. Marathon to collect donations for veterans. Running was both a way to give back and a way to find peace. Last year, the UCLA Department of Military Science gave Kay the prestigious Mark Daily Selfless Service Award for his work raising money for veterans, his volunteer work and his efforts to help other cadets.

The Daily Award, given every year to a member of the graduating cadet class who shows the most dedication to service, was created to honor a UCLA ROTC alumnus who was killed in service on a tour in Iraq.

***

Sunrise and sunset are Kay’s favorite times of day. While he was at UCLA, he made a habit of running at Drake Stadium and watching the sun rise over Westwood.

“I was never upset to be there,” he said.

On Dec. 14, Kay officially commissioned as a military intelligence officer in the Army Reserve. Since graduating in September, he found a job working at Control Risks, a company that offers security services, where his military experience serves him well in analyzing security risks in different parts of the world.

But even after leaving campus, Kay’s habits have stuck with him.

These days, he ventures out to Santa Monica to run on the hard sand that touches the edge of the ocean. When the sun begins to set, he sometimes stops running and sits to watch the sinking light meet the dark water.

Here, he finds another quiet moment.","",1,,ARTICLE,4
255,A perfect day in LA: Around Downtown Los Angeles,perfect-day-la-around-downtown-los-angeles,"Spend a day in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, taking in the sights and eating good food. ","[img127 fullwidth]

[img86 right]

Enter the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, where gritty industrial buildings meet contemporary craftsmanship in a creative hub that has maintained its artistic soul since the ‘80s. Loud art lines the streets of this ever-growing contemporary community, and an array of museums, boutiques, cafes and gourmet eateries can be found at every corner.

Start your day in the Arts District with a visit to Angels Flight Railway on Bunker Hill – an L.A. monument named “The Shortest Railway in the World.” Next, pass through downtown Los Angeles’ historic core, notice Central Library’s stunning cathedral architecture. As you make your way around a plethora of murals in the district, follow the painted black hearts to The Pie Hole, where mouthwatering Mexican chocolate and Earl Grey tea pies await.

Just around the corner sit contemporary home goods stores – such as Poketo and Apolis – that will appeal to anyone with a love for stationary, crafts and decor. After you’ve cast a yearning gaze over the designs, head over to Eat.Drink.Americano, an affordable gastropub with industrial brick walls, plush couches and the best flatbreads in town. End your night in the Arts District ,browsing the installations at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Admission is free every Thursday from 5-8 p.m., so plan accordingly.

[img92 left]

Walk past the artist murals into an old ivy-covered brick building, and you have entered Eat.Drink.Americano, a gastropub located in the heart of the Arts District.

The first thing you’ll notice? The seamless combination of historic- meets-contemporary aesthetic that is reflective of the downtown spirit. High ceilings, wood beams and arched windows abound. The bar stools? Recycled. The communal tables? Made using reclaimed wood from just down the street. And the eye-catching chalkboard wall that hangs from ceiling to floor?

This is the work of artist Peter Greco, dubbed “Lord of the Letter” for his typography skills, who hand-finished the mural in no less than 10 weeks.

Mingling with guests and overseeing it all is restaurant owner Michael Burke, who founded Americano in 1998 alongside his partner, Angie.

“Greco’s work is a reflection of everything Americano encompasses as a restaurant – our utilization of the skilled art community, our commitment to local artisans and craftsmakers, and our overarching appreciation for organic farm produce that is domestic and sustainable,” Burke said.

[img93 fullwidth]

[img88 right]

Originally from the UK, Burke has a keen vision of the internationally influenced, locally produced flavors he puts on the menu.

“We’ll tell you where the produce originated and the background of the farm, distillery or brewery where it was produced,” Burke said.

Equally important to Burke are the relationships he wishes to foster through the community, and he frequents nearby local businesses such as the Bread Lounge, Stumptown Coffee Roasters and various farmers mar- kets in Los Angeles.

While lunches are more in the style of a New York deli, for dinner Burke suggests ordering a variety of dishes such as the meat and cheese charcuterie boards with artisan breads, the braised oxtail sliders or steak tartare with mustard ice cream.

Americano’s New-York style pastrami flatbread with mozzarella and shiitake mushroom, topped with fresh basil, is a classic. And the amaretto-soaked tiramisu is one dessert you do not want to miss.

[img89 left]

As the late afternoon crowd winded down, Burke reflected upon the source of energy that has created the casual, fun spirit of Americano today.

“This area has always been a destination for creative people. Like the meatpacking district in New York City, in the ‘80s and ‘90s artists came for affordable housing, so it has always had that artistic flair. It’s been influenced by a lot of cultures – nearby Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Boyle Heights; it’s a melting pot of cultures. From a workforce perspective, there are lots of creative types in fashion and jewelry but also just white-collar workers too. The artist district is unique in itself. It is continually changing, just like art is.”

How did a charming, simple wallet lead to a global destination for artists and admirers alike? Poketo, an art-decor gallery store founded in 2003 by husband-and-wife duo Angie Myung and Ted Vadakan, stemmed from a desire to create affordable but high-quality design pieces from artists all over the world.

[img94 fullwidth]

Through this concept, the couple began working with various artists to design handcrafted wallets that include a short bio, story and pen as well as contact info.

“We wanted to make something that can travel with you anywhere, as if we’re taking the art off the gallery walls and making it more accessible. We collaborate with artists all over the world, and when we find an item we really like with a story behind it, we’ll work with anyone,” Myung said.

[img90 fullwidth]

Flash forward to 2014, and rows of printed stationary, colorful home goods, canvas backpacks and art magazines are only a few of the distinctly crafted pieces that line the walls of Poketo. As the team’s creative director, Myung cites her grandmother as a main inspiration and the reason behind the store’s name.

[img87 left]

“My grandmother is really dear to my heart and she would always mispronounce certain words like cup (“coppu”) and pocket (“poketo”), and the name just stuck,” she recalled with a smile.

With a 52-piece homeware capsule collection designed for Target under its belt, Poketo is now focused on in-store workshops such as leather-crafting, floral-arranging and calligraphy.

“Handwriting is such a lost art,” Myung mused. The couple is also busy with the opening of the newest branch of Poketo at The Line Hotel in Koreatown. Looks like a visit downtown to these creative spirits is in order.

It is almost a tradition that every marine biology class ends with a depressing lecture on overfishing and the tragic future of the ocean.

“Traditionally, we viewed the sea as a super abundant resource,” said Patricia Halpin, a UCLA marine biology professor. “Now we are coming to an era where (human) population and food pressure are huge, and our ability to harvest resources from the ocean is enormous. Then we realize that (the ocean) is not infinitely exploitable, and it does have to be managed conservatively.”

Some scientific studies predict that by 2114 wild fish stock will be decimated, others say as early as 2048.

But all is not yet lost. You can do your part by eating seafood fished sustainably – that means reducing your consumption of overfished species and supporting fishing methods that have long-term ocean health in mind. Using the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch as a guideline for what’s in danger and what’s not, we went in search of delicious and sustainable seafood in Los Angeles.

# “The $1 Oyster Bar”
## Green Hut Cafe
### 808 W, 7th St., Los Angeles, CA 90017

[img103 fullwidth]

[img96 right]

How many times have you skipped the raw oysters on a seafood restaurant’s menu just because you are trying to save up for next quarter’s textbooks or this weekend’s beer? Raw oysters at Green Hut Cafe are fresh and delicious – and come at an affordable price.

Located on a busy street in downtown, the restaurant has a woody interior that juxtaposes against the concrete appearance of the old city, like a wooden dock connecting two different worlds.

The oyster bar is directly across a long table at the inner end of the res- taurant. If you’re not sure about which kind of oyster you prefer after reading the menu, you can walk across to see the osyters behind glass, labeled with their origin, taste and texture.

We recommend the Eastern oysters, harvested from Delaware and Chesapeake, Va., which are $1 each during happy hour. Although frozen in ice, the meat is soaked in a puddle of brine and looks plump and hearty. The silvery inner lining of the shell reflects the light that falls on it, glittering through the seawater. The oyster meat tastes mellow and firm. Add a few drops of fresh lemon as a final touch. Cheers (slurp)!

[img104 fullwidth]

Oysters are usually farmed hanging inside a mesh bag in the water, with minimal impact on the marine environment. They feed by filtering out micro-organisms or particles in the seawater, directly improving local water quality. Therefore, oyster farming does not directly harm wild fish populations, making it more ocean-friendly and sustainable.

# ""The East Coast Dream”
## Wink’s Lobster & Seafood
### 1800 Avenue of the Stars Los Angeles, CA 90067

[img105 fullwidth]

It is almost magical that such layered flavor in a Maine lobster roll can be found in a compact booth in a farmers market in Los Angeles. Amid a busy farmers market, Wink’s Lobster & Seafood is easily recognizable, with a road sign showing a silhouette of a lobster colored in red.

Brandon Winkler, the business owner, grew up in Casco, Maine.

[img98 left]

“As a kid, we eat lobsters there a few times a week to the point we get sick of it,” he said. Two years ago, he left the finance world and started the lobster roll business.

He pulls out a beige stick of bread, coats each side with a smear of liquid butter and begins to toast it on a pan. “This style of bread is the New England split roll,” he said. “There was only so many bakers who make this on the East Coast and they don’t make it out here (in California).” Eventually, he met a baker who was willing to bake this style of bread exclusively for him.

The golden New England split-top roll purses tightly around the tender lobster meat from Rockland, Maine, vibrantly colored with a naturally pastel red and orange. Although coated with butter, the lobster roll is not even slightly oily. Despite traveling across the country, the lobster still delivers a hint of the virgin taste of the briny ocean in every single bite. According to Seafood Watch, lobster from this area is a more sustainable option than some lobsters caught in other areas.

[img99 fullwidth]

“(My family and I) went out for dinner in a lobster restaurant a few years ago,” Winkler said. “I had all of these memories coming back to me, like the good times I had in Maine. This (business) is a way for me to connect back to the memories from my childhood. It’s like a dream.”

Whenever you get tired of the shenanigans in Los Angeles, Wink’s Lobster & Seafood is just the perfect place for a bit of Northeast culture.

# “An Ambassador of Seafood Sustainability”
## Santa Monica Seafood
### 1000 Wilshire Blvd. Santa Monica, CA 90401

[img95 fullwidth]

A family tradition and an ocean-friendly fish market, Santa Monica Seafood is a great place to stop for your catch of the day.

Founded in 1939 on the Santa Monica Pier, the restaurant moved to the Wilshire location four years ago, said Christopher Wade, the general manager.

[img100 left]

The retail market occupies more than half the restaurant space. Scottish salmon, Alaska halibut, cherrystone clams, New Zealand snapper – you name it – lay neatly behind a glass window labeled with its origin and fishing practice (i.e. wild-caught, natural farm or cultured).

On the right side of the store entrance, cafe tables face Wilshire Boulevard.

A bowl of steamed littleneck clams served with grilled ciabatta is a great dish to start. Each clam is the size of a pingpong ball and sits in a hot winey broth cooked with tomatoes, garlic and onions. The dish is sprinkled with cilantro and scallions, and the clams are chewy and soaked with the essence of the soup. If you’re 21, they go well with a nice glass of wine and a sunny day.

[img101 right]

The smoky swordfish sandwich ($17), our sandwich recommendation, is packed with red onions, tomatoes, arugula and a piece of swordfish covered with chipotle aioli sauce inside two lightly toasted sourdough slices. It is served with a spring mix salad and drizzled with olive oil. The swordfish has the texture of chicken meat, but a bit flakier. The spiciness of the aioli sauce is balanced by the hint of bitterness from the arugula.

“Our buyers are very conscious about where the fishes are coming from,” Wade said. “When Seafood Watch says fish population is dropping below a certain level, we tend not to carry it.”

Sustainable seafood is only possible because consumers and producers work together as a team. Your choice of seafood makes a difference.","",6,,ARTICLE,4

**prime:** What is your biggest design influence or inspiration?

**Alec Moore:** That’s a difficult question. I think that the real impetus of design is just not wanting to live in squalor. Dissatisfaction with your surroundings, really.

**prime:** Many of the items in your apartment are either rehabilitated furniture or DIY. Can you explain how you go about finding pieces to fix or improve?


**AM:** There’s actually a funny story about me finding derelict furniture. That’s really what I try and go for when I’m walking through the streets of Westwood. I try and pay attention more to the form of a piece than the color or the state it’s in – that can always be fixed.

But I was actually walking to campus one day, and I was over by Broad (Art Center) when I saw this fabulous piece of furniture just left out. And I thought “Oh my god, I have to have it, it’s beautiful.” It was this little footstool ottoman with claw-foot legs, and I took it. Little did I know, I had inadvertently stolen a sculpture student’s final and he was having a critique that day. So I had to run it back to campus or be arrested.

**prime:** Speaking of DIY furniture, you rehabilitated the settee in you're living room. What’s the story behind that?

**AM:** Well, it cost $8,000 and I got it from Restoration Hardware. No, I’m kidding. A friend and I found it in an alleyway behind Yamato. It was missing a leg, and it was brown with hideous upholstery.

I knew I wanted it to be white wood, and I knew the upholstery had to be changed. So I decided to tackle it myself. I took all the fabric off, undid the staples and glue and I stained the fabric blue. Then, before I put it back on the frame, I spray-painted the wood white. I also spray-painted my wicker chairs and redid their seats – they were brown before.

**prime:** You have a large painting above your bed, what’s the story behind that?

**AM:** That is ""(Mrs.) Sarah Siddons"" by Thomas Gainsborough from 1785. She was the first really renowned female actress, and she really paved the way for making acting a suitable profession for women.

**prime:** Do you have a favorite piece in the apartment?

**AM:** My favorite piece is probably the bust of Louis (XIV, king of France). I bought Louis in the Louvre (Museum) gift shop several years ago and had him shipped back. And he arrived just smashed to hell and back. And so I spent the entire summer between freshman and sophomore year just gluing the pieces back together.

**prime:** What do you think makes good design?

**AM:** Having good taste.

**prime:** Parting advice for aspiring apartment decorators?

**AM:** Design is so important. It isn’t about being easy. Nothing about cultivating a space is easy. Ugly beige box apartments are easy. You just have to find things yourself and make them what you want them to be.

Sarah Summers, 21
Third-year dance student
Hometown: Sonoma
Type of apartment: two-bedroom

**prime:** What would you say is your favorite thing about interior design?


**Sarah Summers:** I think my room has always been a place where I made things. Whether it’s songwriting or making art, I’ve always been a very project-based person. And so it’s more inspiring and easier to get work done if I’m in a space that cultivates that creativity. For me it’s all about setting the stage for a place where I can actually get stuff done.

**prime:** A lot of your stuff is DIY and has a personal touch. Is there something in particular that draws you to creating your own decor?


**SS:** I think it’s very much a product of how I grew up. My mom worked for a short time as a children’s furniture painter, and so she would go and find old, sort of decrepit tables and dressers and would bring them back to life with paint or gold leaf or even decoupage.

I think part of it comes from my family really liking nice things but not necessarily having a lot of money to go out and buy nice things. I think it builds a little more of an authentic space if you’re building things on your own. Anybody can go out and see something nice and just buy it, and sometimes that’s nice. But it’s not nearly as satisfying as knowing the things in your house are a part of you.

**prime:** Do you have a particular aesthetic style you feel most inspired by?

**SS:** I like clash, but I also like things that are practical. I really like finding ways to tie mismatched, individual pieces together. My first instinct in decorating this place was just to get as much color as possible – we don’t really have a color theme here. But I also like things to be very functional and easy to clean. I feel like that really filters into my style because I don’t like surfaces with lots of cluttered things on them because it’s not as easy to dust.

**prime:** Do you have any tricks or tips for students trying to create a very warm and custom look within a reasonable budget range?


**SS:** I think, honestly, the first thing that you need to learn if you’re interested in home decorating is just basic cleaning skills. Because so many people in college don’t have those, and that prevents them from caring about their space because it’s hard. And it’s so transient here that people come and go through apartments and leave grime.

And it’s much easier to be inspired to decorate a place that smells nice and doesn’t have weird dust. Cleaning is the first thing to do, and it’s cheap, but it requires a lot of love and labor. And then I think just learning to see things as potential decorating utilities – like I use tickets from places I’ve been and flyers from shows that I’ve been to. On their own, it looks like something to throw away. But when you keep them and collect them, you can hang a whole wall full of memories. I think it’s often just hard for students to find the time.


**prime:** What inspires you when you decorate?

**SS:** I think it becomes easier and more exciting for me to decorate when I think about other people being here. It becomes exciting and fun when it’s about people and it’s not just about making things pretty or having nice things. When it’s about making a space where people can come over and feel warm and welcome and happy, that’s what makes me excited about design. It’s really all about people and having a good time.","",18,,ARTICLE,7

Alexis Williams, 21, fourth-year history student

**Hometown?**

Brentwood.

**Why study history?**

I get really worked up when I think about the past. I major in storytelling, really.

**What inspires your style?**

I really like to find things that look nice. I don’t have a really defined style. I like to find things that are comfortable.

**Where do you like to buy clothes?**

Mostly secondhand stores, where things don’t really all look the same. And they’re old – I like old things.

**What’s your favorite place on UCLA’s campus?**

I don’t spend much time on campus, but probably Kerckhoff.

**You’re both a commuter and a transfer student. What are some of the challenges that brings?**

I guess mostly it’s that I’m not really part of Bruin life. Most of my friends don’t go here; I've never lived near campus – I’m just very removed. This is my first year here, and I’m not really in the community.

**What do you think of student style on campus?**

[img366 fullwidth]

Eh. Everyone is in workout clothes or looks like a 12-year-old who lives at Brandy Melville.

**One piece of style advice to give students?**

Don’t try so hard.

**Where did you get your:**

**Pants?** They’re Guess, and I got them from the Fairfax swap meet.

**Shoes?** Doc Martens, from Wasteland.

**Socks?** Men’s socks from Target.

**Top?** American Apparel (I get half off because my friend works there).

**Sweater?** Also from the Fairfax swap meet.

**Rings?** One my mom bought me from a Native American store, and the other one is my great-grandpa’s, he was a Freemason. This was the least gaudy of the rings that he had.

**Necklaces?** The purple one is my friend Anya’s. She’s studying abroad for a year, so I wear it to remind myself of her. The other one is my grandpa’s, and it’s a St. Christopher medal that his high-school girlfriend gave him, so the back of it is inscribed.

Julie Edwards, 22, fourth-year geography/environmental studies student

**Hometown?**

Santa Monica.

**How tall are you?**

Six foot.

**Do you always wear your pants cuffed?**

We both do, actually. No matter what, my pants always hit my ankles at an awkward length, so it’s just easier to have them rolled up.

**Favorite campus coffee shop?**

The SEAS Cafe, in Boelter, with the 99-cent drip coffee.

**Why study geography?**

Especially here, studying geography is really about learning how the world works. I like nature, and we don’t utilize the world in an effective or sustainable way, and studying that really interests me.

[img367 fullwidth]

**How would you describe your style?**


I like simple things because you can throw them together really easily. Clothes that are trendless, in a way. I like normal-looking clothes that have a slight twist on them.

**What do you think of student style on campus?**

In terms of L.A. style, being from here and growing up here, I think the style students have is okay. I think that people here care about their appearance a lot, instead of having fun with the stuff they wear and exploring things they might like. There’s a lot of focus on fitting in with everyone else. But we’re here to go to school; it’s not a runway. People can and should do as they please.

**What’s your favorite place on UCLA’s campus?**

I really like Engineering IV, because it’s like a labyrinth. You get lost – it’s creepy, there’s a hidden courtyard that no one ever goes to, and it’s just this maze of a building. I like that about it.

**As a graduating senior, looking back, do you feel you’ve been part of the UCLA community?**

It’s such a big school. I think that you can always find your little thing that you go to, your activity or group. But it’s not like there’s really a sense of community here at UCLA. There’s no way that we all come together, because there’s just so many people that go to school here that it would be impossible.


**Where did you get your:**

**Shoes?** Birkenstocks.

**Pants?** Gap – shoutout to Gap because they have tall sizes, and I like the material they use because it’s thick but still stretches.

**Shirt?** ASOS.

**Watch?** My dad got it for me. He’s really into tinkering with stuff, so I actually think he made it himself – like he bought the parts and put it together.

**Sweater?** It’s my dad’s, but it doesn’t fit him so he gave it to me. But it’s Hermès, so I’m very protective of it because it’s the one nice thing I own. I think it’s from the '70s.","",10,,ARTICLE,8
260,Projecting the Past,projecting-past,A closer look at Los Angeles’ historic movie theaters,"[img377 fullwidth]

Going to the movies is at once a communal and personal experience.

There is the cackling of the audience during a comedy and the collective gasp at a spine-chilling moment during a horror film. The motley crew of strangers in the drafty, dark auditorium becomes a united congregation – all along for the ride.

But there is also the pleasure of sinking into a plush movie seat that is yours for the next two hours. The intimate connection to the protagonist’s struggle, the utter captivation by plot twists and the savory, nostalgic smell of popcorn makes the vast theater feel like a private dinner with an old friend.

Los Angeles has been the motion picture epicenter for more than a century. Aspiring artists from across the world flock to the hills of Hollywood in hopes of eventually seeing their name on a marquee light.

Movie palaces across the city brought these artists’ work to the townspeople in a magical community space. A space whose existence has been threatened since the first movie palaces opened in the beginning of the 20th century.

Theaters have always been one step behind, having to keep up with the world around them but never running quite fast enough.

Every new decade since the inception of movie palaces has brought new technology and media for the theater industry to compete with. Radio, television and Netflix have carried the best of entertainment into people’s living rooms and bedrooms.

As a result, people are not looking to leave their homes for entertainment in the way they once did.

""From the 1920s to the 1980s, people have been predicting the end of movie theaters,” said Ross Melnick, an assistant professor of film and media studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara and a UCLA alumnus. “The question now is, will movie theaters adapt, as they always have?”

The first theaters in Los Angeles were nickelodeons on Broadway Street in downtown Los Angeles, said Jonathan Kuntz, a film historian and lecturer at UCLA. That generation of movie palaces lasted through the 1920s, until the Great Depression, when the building of movie theaters came to a crashing halt during the 1930s. Many of these 1920s-era theaters still exist, even if they no longer serve their original purpose.

[img375 fullwidth]

“The first generation of picture palaces was on Broadway, then went to Hollywood, then scattered around L.A.,” Kuntz said.

In the 1940s and 1950s, neighborhood movie houses began sprouting around the city. Finally, in the 1970s, multiplexes opened up around town and in the San Fernando Valley, Kuntz added.

But in the early 21st century, during the recession, some movie theaters closed their doors for good.

It was, and still is, uncertain how long movie theaters will survive.

“I think there will always be a niche for them,” Kuntz said. “But there's no clear future for the movie industry.”

It seems the movie theater experience is something Angelenos – and people around the world – are reluctant to let go of. Wherever they go, theaters have made their mark.

*Westwood Village*

Westwood’s Regency Bruin Theatre and Regency Village Theatre are iconic, with a rich history of their own. The Spanish-style, 170-foot tower above the Village theater is an L.A. landmark. Though it still hosts the occasional premiere, the Village theater used to show weekly premieres for blockbuster hits, such as Will Smith’s “Independence Day.”

The Regency Village Theater became an anchor of the Village when it opened in 1931.

“It's one of the last original buildings in the Village still performing its original purpose from 84 years ago,” Melnick said.

Melnick recalls living in an apartment behind the theater in 1996 and seeing the lines for premieres stretch down Weyburn Avenue, as far as he could see, to In-N-Out Burger and beyond. He grew up on the East Coast, watching movies in shopping centers, so the Westwood neighborhood movie house was a refreshing change of pace for him.

The Regency Village Theatre, also known as the Fox Theatre, was the first of its kind in Westwood. Today, it is a prominent movie chain up and down the West Coast.

[img387 fullwidth]

Although the Fox and Bruin theaters have the greatest name recognition today, there were about nine theaters in the Village just a few years ago.

Theaters that have closed include the Mann Festival Theater, which took up residence on Lindbrook Drive in 1970, next door to what is now 800 Degrees Pizza. But the movie house closed in July 2009 during the recession. When the Festival theater originally opened, it replaced the Village’s first Ralphs location, which had been there since 1929.

Whole Foods Market on Gayley Avenue used to be the Mann Westwood 4 theater, which opened in 1975 and closed in 2002.

The Mann Plaza, a single-screen movie house, was located on Glendon Avenue, where the Palazzo Westwood development stands today.

The United Artists Westwood 4 theater was about two blocks south of Wilshire Boulevard before it was renovated to become a CVS pharmacy.

The Crest Theater, which still exists, is located on Westwood Boulevard, a block closer to the Hammer Museum, and shows mainly a mix of old films and operas.

Melnick said one of the greatest losses, though, was the Mann National Theatre, which used to be on Lindbrook Drive. It opened in March 1970, closed in April 2007, reopened less than a month later with a shorter-term lease and was finally razed to the ground in January 2008.

“Westwood suffered an irreparable loss when the National closed,” Melnick said. “It had a fantastic Brady-Bunch-meets-Art-Deco lobby. It was too bad because it was really the other premiere house in Westwood.”

*Greater Los Angeles*

The old feel of the 1920s movie palaces is still palpable on Broadway Street in downtown Los Angeles. Many theaters that were once the epicenter of glamour and glitz still line the street’s busy sidewalks, but they’ve been converted into concert venues or clothing shops.

A standout is the Los Angeles Theatre, one of Kuntz’s favorites.

“It represents so much of the early days of L.A. and movies,” he said. “It’s spectacular.”

Built in 1931 in baroque style, the theater was modeled after King Louis XIV’s Palace of Versailles. When Kuntz visited the palace in France and walked through the ornate Hall of Mirrors, he immediately noticed a connection to the pattern in the Los Angeles Theatre lobby.

The theater has preserved many of its original features, like its ""crying room,” on the mezzanine level where mothers could take their inconsolable infants without missing the film. Moreover, the theater’s original periscope still resides in the women’s restroom, so female patrons could keep watching the movie while they primped, Kuntz said. While the theater does not show movies any longer, it continues to host special events.

“The Los Angeles has a rather restrained facade, but inside, it overwhelms you in its replication of French Renaissance style,” Melnick said. “It takes your breath away.”

Another L.A. icon is The Cinefamily, located in the Fairfax District. It is housed in the former Silent Movie Theatre, which opened in 1942 and showed only silent movies.

[img376 fullwidth]

Though the lights haven’t gone out on the theater, it has a dark past.

In 1997, a theater projectionist named James Van Sickle paid a man $25,000 to kill the Silent Movie Theatre’s 74-year-old owner, Lawrence Austin. Austin had left his $1 million estate to Van Sickle, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, along with the man he hired to kill Austin.

This horror-filled theatrical incident sent the theater into disarray for a few years, Melnick said. But it reopened as The Cinefamily on Halloween in 2007, and shows everything from silent movies to contemporary films.

A short drive away from The Cinefamily is the New Beverly Cinema in West Hollywood.

Located in a primarily Orthodox Jewish neighborhood, the building stands out on the street with its pastel blue, lilac and pink exterior.

The theater’s movies have an offbeat personality as well.

The movie house started out in the 1920s as a vaudeville theater, and Quentin Tarantino bought the theater in 2007 to help operations. Today, the theater shows almost exclusively double-feature 35mm films from Tarantino’s personal collection.

***

For Melnick, the movie theater he chooses to go to is as much of a decision as which movie he should watch.

He takes all possible factors into consideration beforehand: whether he wants an intimate setting or a gigantic auditorium, if there will be a line outside where he can eagerly await the film with fellow moviegoers, if he can talk to people about the movie in the lobby afterward.

“Movie houses are far more than places where they show movies, it's about curating your own experience,” he said. “It's still one of the last places where people around the world gather with strangers for a not-religious experience.""

Unlike the experience of watching a movie alone, the reaction of the crowd changes the movie for him.

“People clapping after a movie, or walking out during it – the experience is more than a movie,” he said. “You can just lose yourself.”","",5,,ARTICLE,8

*""La vida es sufrir.""*

Life is suffering.

I was sitting in my grandmother’s kitchen two days after my high school graduation when she cupped my face and said this to me. Her hands left their work at the stove to direct my gaze, to say, “Look at me.” She was earnest and unafraid.

Three years after she said them, I hear her words in my sleep.

I believe there is a place between the worlds of the living and the dead where diasporic peoples imagine the things they cannot know: unreal abstractions of ancestors who lived on different soil, the winding roads of a place that is home in their blood and their bones. This is the place where my grandmother’s words have come to resonate – somewhere imagined, half-alive, singing with the magic of old truths passed down.

This is the place where I imagine a legacy that gives my life meaning.

When I arrived at UCLA, I had not thought about being Mexican – really thought about it, as more than a box I checked on forms – in years. It is in fact possible that I had never thought about it at all.

The fact of my Mexican-ness was like the fact of my home address – a thing over which I had no say and to which I could not ascribe very much importance if I tried. This was, I thought, how it was supposed to be. Shouldn’t I focus on other ways to define myself? Things I had control over, things I could create myself?

Slowly, though, I began to have experiences that unnerved me, shook me up, left me angry. I was at once committed to the path I had chosen for myself – one that ignored race, one where I felt allowed to create a self that felt no burden of difference – and unable to reconcile that path with my own conscience.

During my second year, while some of my friends from home started involving themselves in Chicana/o activism and solidarity movements at their respective colleges, I joined the newspaper, where I could count the number of brown people on staff on one hand. This choice felt both innocuous and momentous – I was choosing who I would be, where I would stand. I have never regretted this decision, but I have regretted the quick and flippant way I cast off whole parts of myself to make it.

During my third year, I started going out a lot on the weekends. Every week, it was something new: a man grabbed my hair in his fist and asked me “what I was,"" another told me I was pretty for a Hispanic girl. I went home thinking quietly about feeling othered – how my white girlfriends were also getting harassed, but how my harassment felt different somehow. Not worse, exactly, but different.

I carried the sense of difference with me into the street, into my friendships. I could not stand to cook things my roommate looked at funny. I bought Mexican candy at the store and never ate it. I looked around at every friend I made in college and could not count a single brown face in the entire bunch.

I began to wonder why I felt so uncomfortable. I began to remember things.

When she was 5 years old, my little sister started going to kindergarten in the predominantly white area we had just moved to. She met a blond-haired, blue-eyed little girl for the first time that day and came home reporting to us all that she had “met a real princess.” Throughout elementary school, she would tell me over and over in our room that she wanted to have lighter skin.

I remembered being a teenager, looking at my face in the bathroom mirror and frantically, desperately, illogically wanting blue eyes.

I remembered my mother: the way she never says no, the way quiet resentment builds in a household where no one thinks to ask her if she’s tired.

It has only been through remembering these things that I have managed to move past them. It has only been through the shared pain, triumph and strength of the women in my family that I have managed to find a profound kind of grace within myself.

I think of my grandmother now, cupping my face and giving me a warning rooted in love. It’s possible she was not trying to tell me anything except exactly what she said, something sad and true of her own life. But I see it now as a legacy of the women in my family.

I listen to her telling me that life is suffering, and I hear a generations-long story about women I have never met and do not know, but whom I imagine in a place between the worlds of the living and the dead.

[img313 fullwidth]

I hear something ancient and powerful in her, and I feel something profound in me too, in my own conviction to cup my grandmother’s face in my hands and tell her that it doesn’t have to be that way.

264,Recipe: Snacking on fruits and ve(chip)tables,recipe-snacking-fruits-and-vechiptables,"Daily Bruin Mojo blogger Amy Giroux's recipe for simple, healthy and delicious fruit and vegetable chips. ","I am prone to frequent snack attacks. The kind that has you staring at the pantry for a solid 10 minutes, trying to decide what on earth your taste buds are craving. Sweet? Salty? Tummy-filling or just a bite? Midday or midnight, this snack habit is usually the adversary of my dinner appetite and my waistline. After almost four years of college, I have finally learned how to channel my snack cravings into a healthy habit with fruit and veggie chips.

# Basic recipe

[img74 fullwidth]

Slice fruits and veggies as thinly as possible. Though you can use a sharp knife to make all your cuts, I highly recommend purchasing a mandolin – it’s totally worth the investment. Our local City Target has them for about $13.

[img73 fullwidth]

Using a separate bowl for each chip flavor, lightly toss vegetables in olive oil – just enough to cover each piece. For fruits, toss apples and pears in lemon juice – again, using just enough to cover each piece. Do not oversaturate your fruits and veggies. Avoid berries – too much juice and sugar – but mangoes also make excellent candidates.

[img75 fullwidth]

Add desired seasonings to the bowl in proportions based on your own preferences. See the table below for our ideas.

[img125 fullwidth]

After coating chips in the bowls with olive oil/lemon juice and seasonings, lay each piece on a prepared baking sheet lined with parchment paper. (Note: If you use aluminum foil to cover your cookie sheets, make sure to use butter to grease the foil. Otherwise, the sugar will stick and your chips will burn to a crisp.) Ensure that pieces do not touch.

[img72 fullwidth]

Sprinkle a light layer of seasonings of your choice over the chips.

Bake at the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit noted on the table below. Multiple types can be baked on the same sheet or at the same time, but make sure you watch them carefully. The line between “perfect” and “burnt” is a matter of minutes.

Flip the chips using a fork, spatula or tongs midway through baking. Chips are finished when the edges begin to crisp and curl and the pieces are no longer floppy or moist.

Toss the veggie chips with sea salt just prior to serving if desired.

[img76 fullwidth]

Chips may be kept in an airtight container or bag for up to one week (if you don’t eat them all before then).

265,Insuring Identity,insuring-identity,Transgender students at UCLA face a myriad of challenges,"[img371 fullwidth]

Bo Hwang was 15 years old when he started to realize his gender identity didn’t align with his biological sex.

“Growing up, I always thought I was a boy,” said Hwang, a first-year gender studies student. “I didn’t realize until middle school that there was a difference between boys and girls.”

But he didn’t immediately embrace his identity as a transgender man. Hwang said he was still unsure about his gender identity when he was a teenager, though he remembers wanting to transition since high school.

It wasn’t until he found a community of openly queer students at UCLA that Hwang decided he definitely wanted to transition away from his biologically assigned sex and eventually embrace his true gender identity as a man.

A number of UCLA students – somewhere between 50 and 400 – identify as transgender. They face challenges on many levels as they try to fit into the UCLA community, including discrimination and tough choices about how to transition both socially and physically.

The decision to take steps toward gender reassignment often weighs heavily on the minds of young transgender people, many of whom encounter the chance to make medical, social and financial decisions on their own for the first time at college.

For Hwang, the decision over whether or not to transition came down to finances.

He wants to wait to undergo gender reassignment until he has the financial means to support himself and access to health insurance that will pay for the procedures and ongoing medical treatment he will need.

“I will need to take one or two shots a month for the rest of my life,” he said.

Insurance-covered medical care for transgender people was hard to come by until last year. In May 2014, a U.S. Department of Health and Services review board ruled that Medicare recipients cannot be automatically denied coverage for gender reassignment procedures.

While the ruling doesn’t seem to have direct impact on the majority of UCLA students – most 18- to 24-year-olds are not eligible for Medicare coverage – it was widely speculated that the ruling indicated a shift in insurance policies for younger patients, in both the public and private sector.

But even before this ruling, UCLA students had access to some transgender health services, including gender reassignment procedures. The University of California Student Health Insurance Plan covers ""medically necessary"" gender reassignment surgery and other services for transgender patients.

Doctors and health insurance companies determine medical necessity on a case-by-case basis for each patient. This depends on a number of factors, including how the person is progressing in therapy and whether that person has met certain benchmarks to qualify for surgical procedures.

Since August 2010, UC SHIP has covered $1.4 million in medical claims related to transgender procedures, treatments and services, said UC spokeswoman Shelly Meron in an email statement. Overall, students have filed about 127 claims related to transgender health care over the past five years.

But health care for transgender Americans isn’t guaranteed by all insurance companies. Many insurance companies won’t offer any coverage related to transgender health concerns, whether that includes therapy, surgeries or hormone treatments.

Even government-supported insurance doesn’t necessarily cover transgender health care.

TRICARE, the federally funded insurance provided to military service members and their families, only covers sex changes if “gender confusion is documented from birth.” This would essentially restrict access to sex changes to people who were born hermaphrodites or with no clear sexual identification and would withhold procedures from transgender individuals who embraced their gender identity later in life. Several other private insurance companies hold similar policies regarding transgender-related health care.

However, for most transgender individuals, gender identity emerges as they grow up and begin to develop a conception of what gender means to them.

[img373 fullwidth]

Nyala Carbado, a first-year history and African American studies student, began to notice their gender identity in ninth grade.

“For me, I think it’s hard (to define) because sometimes I feel like I’m gender-fluid, going between genders, and other times I feel like I’m agender,” Carbado said.

Carbado identifies as genderqueer and prefers the pronouns they, them and theirs.

They described the issue of gender identity as separate from sexual orientation, and said they think this distinction is something many UCLA students and people are unaware of.

Regardless of their gender identity, transgender people have a sexual orientation that varies across a spectrum of sexual identities, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual and asexual. Gender identity only relates to a personal perception of gender and gender expression.

“There’s a sense of not being interested in learning about it,” they said. “The diversity requirement is one of the first steps (toward more education). Just one class can really help to open one’s mind and help people see things in somebody else’s perspective.”

Carbado said they think just being exposed to transgender people and the human rights issues facing that community will help improve the lives of students whose gender identity doesn’t fit perfectly with their biologically assigned sex.

They added that gender identity is complicated by many factors, such as race, age and gender presentation.

“Sometimes, because I do pass as male, I don’t wear my hoodie when I’m walking alone at night,” Carbado said.

Carbado, who is black, said the prejudices against black men can affect them even though they do not identify as a man.

In addition to various levels of intersecting identities within the queer community, Carbado said they felt as if their actions were often perceived as an indication of the queer community at large.

“What I do reflects the queer community,” Carbado said. “A lot of people feel that way.”

Hwang agreed that his actions are often taken to represent those of all transgender men, but he said he thinks the conflation is not fair or productive.

“Some people treat me like the golden boy, and treat me like I represent all trans men,” he said. “It’s really hard for me because I have so many different identities: Asian, low-income, Christian.”

Hwang said balancing all of these different identities has led to some discrimination, but he has also noticed acceptance of his identity as a Korean transgender man who holds his faith in God as an important part of his life.

Hwang recalled a time when two students he'd met before were walking down Bruin Walk and pointed him out as they passed by. In Korean, they gossiped about his gender identity and expressed disbelief that Hwang was really a man.

[img372 fullwidth]

“They thought that I didn’t speak Korean, but I speak fluent Korean,” he said. “It’s kind of hard. When (people) misgender me, I start to become quiet and I feel smaller. I feel like my voice doesn’t matter.”

Other times, Hwang said he has benefited from people’s perceptions of his gender presentation. He said he doesn’t often encounter issues when using public restrooms, because strangers tend to accept his identity as a man without question.

“I think I’m privileged because I’m Korean,” he said. “No one questions my gender much. My white trans friends get confronted more often.”

Both Hwang and Carbado said the queer community at UCLA has been an important support system.

“It’s a small number of people, but they’re very active,” Carbado said. “You always see them at causes, even if they are not queer causes. That’s one of the reasons I’m proud to be in that community.”

Hwang didn’t have a community of peers at his high school or community college.

“It was rare to meet a queer person, let alone a trans person,” he said. “There’s a huge (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community on campus. I really like that.”

Hwang said it was because of the queer community at UCLA that he decided to officially come out as a transgender man and start presenting his gender as male. He said when he saw transgender people at UCLA who were out and happy because of their decision, he was sure he wanted to transition as well.

For now, Hwang is psychologically and socially transitioning to his masculine gender identity. He said he’s coming out and using male spaces regularly.

“I want to be as open as possible,” he said. “I want to educate and raise awareness, because I want people to take action (for transgender rights).”","",6,,ARTICLE,8
266,Eye for Design: Student photographer's work takes unique angle,eye-design,This quarter prime followed Design | Media Arts student Rakeem Cunningham on a men’s fashion shoot at the beach. See his photos and read about his inspiration.,"[img153 fullwidth]

Rakeem Cunningham is no stranger to eccentric outfits and 7 a.m. call times. On a pristine blue morning at the Santa Monica Pier, onlookers stop to observe a model clad in a textured oversized coat and monochrome white, unaware that the photographer behind the lens is a student at UCLA. Cunningham, a fourth-year Design | Media Arts student who said he used to hate the idea of shooting fashion, only started taking photos professionally in his second year, after helping his fashion designer cousin. Since then, through working with a variety of magazines, such as Chasseur and Rocket, he has discovered a knack for conceptual photography.

Unable to find a fashion organization he identified with on campus, Cunningham turned to real-world sources, exposing himself to designers, trends and changing fashion seasons around the world in the process.

[img154 fullwidth]

“When I first started, I wanted to do a James Dean-themed shoot in the middle of summer,” Cunningham said. “My friends were like, Rakeem … it doesn’t work like that.”

Cunningham’s volume of work reflects a passion for capturing simple, understated aesthetics and a photographic style that appears raw and effortless.

[img155 fullwidth]

“Oh, but it’s effort,” Cunningham quipped. “My work doesn’t have to be groundbreaking, it just has to be something creative I haven’t done before.”

Right now, Cunningham describes his work as “British,” pointing to the U.K.’s mixture of daring, high-end street wear, such as kilts with nose rings and layered jerseys.

“I’m attracted to dark, somber subjects that aren’t as PG as my photography once was,” Cunningham said. He cites his favorite photographer, Tim Walker, who uses film to create ethereal images in dark, moody settings, as a major source of inspiration.

Although Cunningham has learned to incorporate a fluid mesh of fine arts and design into his work today, the realization that the two styles could complement each other did not come easily.

[img156 right]

While in a photography class as a fine arts student, Cunningham was told by his professor that his fashion-related projects did not fit the realm of fine arts.

“So for my next idea, I used a photo of my sister with a sign reading, ‘Is this art now?’ And then I switched majors,” Cunningham said. “But it’s funny because now, I’m really enjoying mixing the two. I’m learning you don’t have to know exactly what you want to do, but if you work at something hard enough, people will notice and respond.”

Through the collaborative, detailed process of fashion photography, Cunningham has created strong, lasting relationships with stylists, models and creatives alike. In fact, his shoot for prime magazine features celebrity stylist Wilford Lenov, whom Cunningham met two years ago and has creatively grown with ever since.

Lenov said that the moment he really appreciated and respected Cunningham’s art was last summer, when Cunningham broke his leg and the pair worked together constantly to fulfill his need to keep photographing.

“We were shooting by Broad (Art Center), and as soon as I turned my back away to fix something, his wheelchair started slowly falling backwards, and I hear, ‘Wilford. Wilford?’” Lenov said, laughing. “To want it that bad ... it’s crazy, and it’s inspiring.”

[img157 left]

Before this year, Cunningham admits he was scared to express his opinions about the negative aspects of the industry he’s in. Lenov added that recently, Cunningham’s work has become far more bold and daring.

For his senior project, Cunningham created a video about different things he experienced as a 21-year-old, including depression, sexuality, racism, creativity and artistic freedom.

“I’ve found that the more I’m honest and true to myself, the more people react to it, and it’s really empowering,” Cunningham said. “I want to do things that satisfy me creatively, and the ripples that have resulted have just been insane.”

As for his future? “I have absolutely no idea,” Cunningham said.

Cunningham dreams of shooting the cover of Vogue someday, but for now, his main interest lies in fine arts and expressing experimental ideas.

“All I know now is that I want to keep creating. Hopefully in New York or London. That would be my aha moment.”

267,Arab a(part),prime-winter-sari,"Daily Bruin Mojo editor Sari Zureiqat on Arab identity, religion and perceptions of the Middle East","[img314 fullwidth]

I thought I understood my Jordanian-American-Christian identity until last winter break, when I found out my dad used to be an anti-religious communist who secretly took a year off his schooling in the USSR to fight in Lebanon alongside a Palestinian group circa 1981.

Casual, I know.

We were walking our dog when he subtly mentioned that one time he was approached by wild dogs in Lebanon, but ""They didn't do anything, son, and I had weapons with me."" I, of course, had to ask why he'd ever needed to carry weapons in in the first place.

""Honey,"" he asked in Arabic, turning to my mother. “Haven't we told him that story yet?""

This ""story,"" of course, was a jolt, considering it came from the mouth of my now very pacifist, very Christian father. The same father who serves my friends fruit and tea when they come over, and who surprised me with a message in my iPhone's Notes app when I came home from UCLA one weekend: ""I love you my son when you come back.""

So an anecdote about fighting Israeli forces? Not so casual, baabaa.

Grappling with stories like this is tough because I’m both Arabic and Christian, two identities that don’t normally mix.

As a family, our Arab denunciation of injustice done to Palestinians has often found itself at odds with a Christian (and, often, American) respect for Israel. With this conflict, I've always been in limbo, neither here nor there, not knowing where to stand on divisive issues or with whom to associate myself.

It’s been like this for as long as I can remember.

Born in Amman, Jordan, in 1994, I came to California as a bright-eyed 4-year-old who soon attended an American, Lutheran preschool on weekdays and an Arabic-speaking church on weekends. I went to public school from kindergarten onward, but that didn’t make me any less confused about culture and faith.

At 8 years old, I attended Calvary Chapel, an American megachurch in Costa Mesa, in addition to my family's original Arabic church – sometimes alternating Sundays, sometimes attending both in the same day. By then, I had started to notice small, nagging anomalies in how I viewed myself.

At my Arabic church, we held an annual Day of Prayer for the Arab World and the U.S. I saw images of congregation members' homelands being torn apart and churches bombed. On potluck days, my relatives would often bring traditional Arabic pastries that corresponded to cultural holidays, sometimes Muslim ones.

At the American church, I was told to pray for Israel. Sunday school teachers pointed to passages like Isaiah 43, which proclaim that Israel is “precious in (the Lord’s) sight.” In similar stride, they’d point to the New Testament, which notes that ""salvation"" (an obviously critical part of Christianity) ""is of the Jews"" (John 4:22).

Something didn’t fit. The two calls to prayer weren’t mutually exclusive, but the emphasis on each side was.

In which way was I supposed to pray?

The problem here is rhetorical. Christians in the Middle East are a minority, comprising [5 percent of the region’s population](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11509256), according to BBC. Christians in the U.S. are a majority.

[img316 fullwidth]

I found myself leaning toward my American-Christian side, favoring a culture I saw as easier to adapt to and less archaic. At American church, we sang fun songs and talked about Jesus; at Arabic church, we had to hear sad stories about the state of our homeland.

My naive facade started to crack in middle school, when I heard of Palestinians who suffered as a result of Israeli settlements. My uncle – who married my dad's sister – is one of them. A now-Christian who grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, he credits his survival to people like Yasser Arafat, leaders who fought for the Palestinian cause. And while he concedes to the biblical support of Israel, my uncle has trouble supporting the Israel of today.

My uncle’s father was shot in Lebanon before his eyes. After the event, Arafat ensured the relocation of my uncle’s family from the refugee camp to better housing in Beirut. So while Arafat often used terrorist tactics which I can’t condone, to refugees like my uncle, he was a hero.

In ninth grade, I was assigned an essay about a human rights activist I felt I could relate to. Inspired by my uncle’s story, I tried writing the essay on Arafat. I was shaken writing it – I wanted so badly to understand my uncle, but my experiences in American church left me feeling detached and confused. I felt bad when I couldn’t understand the Israeli-Palestinian situation, and worse, that I couldn’t relate.

That same year, I was elected president of my freshman class, and I organized a bonding event for members of our associated student body class committee. For the event, I picked up a few pepperoni pizzas from Costco, to the delight of most and to the disappointment of two Middle Eastern, Muslim classmates of mine who couldn't eat pork. I apologized profusely for my lack of religious awareness, but it wasn't enough to prevent me from being vilified via instant message when I got home.

""You're a dirty racist pig,"" one of my classmates told me that night. ""I should've thrown you into a trash can when I had the chance.""

For an Arab, regardless of religion, Muslim culture is very much a part of life – and I couldn't believe I hadn't been aware of that critical part. I'd never felt less Arabic in my life.

***

[img318 fullwidth]

The next several years became an effort to understand my own culture. It meant that I invited my high school friends over for Jordanian meals like mansaf (a rice dish with meat and yogurt broth traditionally eaten with your hands), and when I got to college, I chose to fulfill my UCLA foreign language requirement with a year of Arabic.

In that Arabic class, I learned an interesting tidbit of information: The Arabic word for the West, al-gharb, bears the same root of the word for strange – ghareeb.

I couldn’t help but feel that Christianity had made me Western and estranged. Which is funny, because Christianity itself is inherently non-Western. It originates with Jesus, very much in the Middle East.

I began to wonder how we had reached a point in which two nonconflicting identities had become “strange” to each other. The answer may lie in how American culture views the Middle East.

The more I look back at my childhood, the more I cringe at how simplistic the American perception of the region is, often reeking of patronizing Orientalism.

In elementary school, I learned that the Middle East is important for two reasons: ancient Egypt and oil.

In seventh-grade world history, the history of the Middle East was taught almost exclusively as the history of Islam.

In 10th-grade AP European history, the Middle East was the Ottoman Empire, and then later, the pawn of imperialism.

In college, the Middle East is the talk of university divestment, tumultuous uprisings and debates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Sometimes, Arabic is a cool language to use for tattoos.

[img320 fullwidth]

What’s missing?

The familial-centered culture of hospitality. Food that extends beyond the scope of Sabra hummus eaten with pretzels and carrot sticks. The plurality of ideas, faiths and peoples in key cities and trade routes that shaped this “cradle of civilization.” The history in ruins and monuments, and even in the very landscape itself – the Jordan River, the Dead Sea.

This is lost every time I watch nightly news about President Barack Obama visiting the Middle East, while video clips of bombs and explosions dance in the background. This is lost every time ""Arab"" is unequivocally met with mentions of Islam and of violence, as if being Arabic must involve both – or worse, that the two must be related.

It might just be me, after all. I did grow up with a father whose identity I need multiple breaths to recite.

Christian, communist, fighter, pacifist – yet my dad still happens to be the most Arabic man I know.

And I’m my father’s son.","",14,,ARTICLE,7

# Classroom Aquatic
- To be released by the end of 2014

[img187 fullwidth]

[img183 right]

The idea was spontaneous – someone blurted out that dolphins are smart and humans are stupid. Add the concept of cheating and throw in a new piece of virtual reality technology, and Classroom Aquatic was born.

Classroom Aquatic is a humorous stealth cheating game created during an Oculus Rift game jam last August by a group including UCLA alumni. In the game, you are a human diver who is in a school of dolphins – literally. Your goal is to do the best you can on the multiple-choice quiz your dolphin professor gives you, and judging by the impossibly hard questions it asks, your best bet is to sneakily look at the other students' tests for guidance.

What sets the game apart is its use of the Oculus Rift – a virtual reality head-mounted display. While wearing the device, you can pivot to look around and see other dolphins’ tests, even leaning forward to try to get a better view.

When released, the game will feature a full story mode that places the player in a variety of situations, from sabotaging science fair projects to going to prom with two different dolphins. The game will hopefully serve as a morality tale about cheating, thrusting individuals in a situation and having them comes to term with the actions they have taken, said Remy Karns, a graduate student at USC responsible for the production and writing of the game.


# Papers, Please
- Released in 2013
- Made by Lucas Pope
- For the computer
- $9.99
- Difficulty: Hard

[img185 fullwidth]

Papers, Please places you in the role of an immigration agent on the border of Arstotzka, a fictional communist country in the 1980s. Since you have won the position from the job lottery, your extended family is relying on you to support them. Every day you trudge over to the border, where you inspect the variety of people trying to enter the country. In the beginning, you simply have to inspect a passport and deny all foreigners. As the days pass, bureaucratic pressure mounts and you are faced with growing amounts of documents to sort through to determine if someone should be allowed to enter Arstotzka.

The game is hard, offering very few directions early on, and stark, simple graphics help drive the straightforward mechanics of the game. Very quickly, the core conflict of the game becomes keeping you and your family alive. As you struggle through your job, you are constantly faced with ethical dilemmas. A guard asks you to detain more people, offering a kickback every time you do so. Various entrees offer to pay you money. Others beg you, pleading to not be separated from their spouses. Then, a rebel group secretly contacts you to help overthrow the current regime.

[img186 fullwidth]

The game forces you to make difficult decisions. Cutting back on expenses like heat and food will leave your family more susceptible to illness – and in need of costly medicine. Conversely, accepting the bribes, kickbacks, and other actions might leave a sour taste in your mouth. The combinations of these decisions result in 20 different endings. These ethical decisions and the grinding monotony of the gameplay are what empower the game’s social commentary.


# Papo & Yo
- Released in 2013
- Made by Minority Media
- For the PS3 and computer
- $14.99
- Difficulty: Easy

[img191 fullwidth]

Papo & Yo is a fantasy adventure game where the player controls Quico, a young Brazilian boy as he explores a fantastical favela, or Brazilian shanty town, that he discovers while hiding in his closet away from his alcoholic and abusive father. Overall, the game is short, offering maybe five or six hours of gameplay with limited replayability, but employs a strong narrative to guide the player through the game.
Quico soon teams up with Lula, a toy-like robot that serves as Quico’s jetpack, and Monster, a large pink monster that resembles a rhinoceros. Despite his looming shadow that chases Quico early in the game, Monster initially serves a rather comic role. Quico can trampoline off Monster’s belly while Monster sleeps to reach distant locations. Many puzzles involve luring Monster to different locations, using food as bait to have Monster solve a variety of puzzle challenges.

[img192 fullwidth]

Even though Monster seems benign, Quico discovers that Monster is addicted to eating large green frogs nearly the size of Quico. When Monster eats these frogs, he lives up to his name, stampeding, spurting fire, and pursuing and attacking Quico. His first transformation is unexpected.

Once this discovery is made, the bulk of the game involves Quico and Monster questing to find the shaman who can cure Monster of his addiction. As the game progresses, the story slowly parallels Monster with Quico’s alcoholic father. While subtle at first, this connection becomes increasingly apparent as the game ends, transforming the game from a childish exploration of a magical favela to a navigation of Quico’s relationship with his alcoholic father.

“Now here’s a kid whose whole world got all twisted, leaving him stranded on a rock in the sky.” So the narration for Bastion, an acclaimed action role-playing game, begins in the aftermath of a huge catastrophe called the Calamity. The world was just destroyed and the main character, a nameless kid, finds himself alone and the entire population turned to statues of ash. The Kid heads to the Bastion, an emergency location that everyone agreed to go to if something happens. There, he discovers one other person who survived, named Rucks, who sends the Kid off on a quest for crystal cores to power the Bastion.

[img188 fullwidth]

The entire game is narrated by Rucks, whose country-western drawl guides you through the game, driving the story through a world filled with vibrant colors and a hand-painted feel. While exploring, the Kid meets two other survivors, Zulf and Zia. With these four dramatis personae, the game slowly evolves into a story not just about survival, but also reconciliation of the racial hatred and tension from a war 50 years ago. As the Kid, the player is given a chance to try to bridge this gulf between the two races as he discovers the mysterious cause of the Calamity.

[img189 fullwidth]

Replaying Bastion allows for tackling additional challenges and delving into the backstory of each of the characters. You can actively modify how hard the game is by invoking a pantheon of idols to buff the enemies. The buffs range from giving the enemies regeneration to increasing their speed.","",3,,ARTICLE,5

College has often been used as a synonym for self-discovery. On this campus, we have four years to supposedly figure out who we are – what we believe in, what we value and who we want to be. Of course, that’s easier said than done.

As students, our history and our passions are very much intertwined with our identity. Who we are is not only where we came from, but also what we love and care about.

Despite the hopes and dreams we have, the path to personal growth can often be fraught with fear and judgment, the self-loathing and uneasiness so often characterized by young adulthood. Still, we persevere – taking new risks and making new discoveries in hopes of honing our sense of self.

The stories inside this issue of prime mirror that sentiment. From deeply personal examinations of the ways culture impacts identity to explorations of the things that drive us – like magic, biology or fashion – every story found inside these pages champions individuality.

271,'The Godmother' of all sandwiches,godmother-all-sandwiches,Rumor has it that the founder of Bay Cities Italian Deli and Bakery in Santa Monica was a retired Chicago policeman on the run from the mafia.,"[img315 fullwidth]

Rumor has it that the founder of Bay Cities Italian Deli and Bakery in Santa Monica was a retired Chicago policeman on the run from the mafia.

Antonio DiTommaso was told it was in his “best interest to move out West,” according to deli lore, said Hector Padilla, general manager at Bay Cities.

To escape any kind of retribution, DiTommaso picked up his life and moved to California, leaving police work behind for customer service. In 1925, he transformed a storefront on Lincoln Boulevard into a deli where Angelenos could get their Italian sandwich fix.

Padilla said the shop has gone through five different owners since DiTommaso.

Today, 90 years later, in a location next door to the original one, the sandwich counter is as busy as ever, and the small storefront on Lincoln Boulevard has grown into a mecca for gourmet cheeses, hundreds of olive oils, balsamic vinegars and every conceivable topping for a hearty Italian sandwich. Although the deli and its clientele have significantly expanded since it opened at the beginning of the 20th century, the deli has maintained a friendly, bustling neighborhood atmosphere.

And Padilla takes great care to make his customers feel at home. Whether you’re a new customer or a regular, he’ll pat your shoulder and point you toward something in the shop he thinks you’ll like.

“This is like my living room, and all these people are just coming in to visit,” Padilla said.

Indeed, it is like Padilla’s home away from home. He and several of his family members – his uncle, aunt and their four children – work at the deli with him.

He even makes Los Angeles celebrities feel like part of the family. He said he’s seen dozens of them come and go throughout his nine years at the deli, and a few are close friends.

Dustin Hoffman, who told Padilla he was normally a tequila man, went through a change of heart at Bay Cities. At Padilla’s suggestion, he tried the shop’s Glenmorangie Nectar D’Or single-malt Scotch, and now it’s his regular purchase. Hilary Swank, Ramon Martinez and Joe Montana are some of the many famous, familiar faces at the deli.

Padilla said although he loves helping and joking with celebrities at the deli, his favorite customers are pregnant women.

When he sees a pregnant woman come into the shop wide-eyed and starving, he pulls her aside and gets her order.

“Now I see some of their 3- and 4-year-old kids come in, and I’m like, ‘I remember you when you were in your mommy’s tummy!’ And they’re like, ‘What?,’” he said, laughing.

Bay Cities has more to offer than just your standard small-market fare. The shop offers specialty housewares – like crepe spreaders and ravioli stamps – that are hard to find elsewhere. The line for the deli counter – where you can find everything from meatballs to custom sandwiches – usually extends out the door.

[img317 left]

I tried the establishment’s signature sandwich – “The Godmother” – and two other specialty sandwiches, called ""The Spaniard"" and ""The Little Don Lorenzo.""

**The Godmother**

The Godmother, Bay Cities’ claim to fame since the 1950s, is definitely not for the faint of stomach. Plan on skipping breakfast before and dinner after if you wish to try it out, because that’s how long you will be full.

It’s a colossal mound of four kinds of meat – Genoa salami, mortadella coppacola, ham and prosciutto – stacked underneath provolone, mustard, mayo, pickles, stringy onions, spicy pepperoncini, lettuce and tomato.

The first bite into the deli’s freshly baked bread is a religious experience. It has just the right amount of crunch on the crust to ward off sogginess from the sloppy sandwich fillings, but not so much to suggest staleness. Its pillow-like, doughy center pairs beautifully with the spiciness of the mustard and peppers, turning down the heat when needed.

The deli bakery also sells loaves of bread inside the shop. The in-house baked bread was the brainchild of Padilla’s uncle. His uncle, the master baker of the family, started baking bread at Bay Cities around a decade ago so that the deli did not have to order it from an outside vendor.

The meat is what makes the sandwich famous. Four kinds of high-quality, rich and savory flavors combine to make a smooth, if messy, sandwich-eating experience. The peppers and mustard add spice and zing that keeps your lips tingling, but not so much spice as to overpower the meat and cheese flavors.

The Godmother, like any other mother, is lovable, but a little high maintenance. The fillings can be tricky, too: After my attempt to balance all the flavors in one bite, all of the meat, cheese and vegetables slid out of the sandwich in one fell swoop. Overall, though, it’s utterly satisfying.

Tip: Split a large The Godmother with a friend, and pair the sandwich with chips of your choice before washing it down with Italian soda.

[img321 right]

**The Spaniard**

After studying abroad in Salamanca, Spain, this past summer, Spanish sandwiches – called bocadillos – will always have a place in my heart. They are usually served on baguette-like bread with olive oil and thinly sliced jamón (ham) or some other kind of meat.

The Spaniard at Bay Cities is definitely a fancier take on the traditional bocadillos. It’s stuffed with Pamplona chorizo – from the city that hosts the running of the bulls festival in July – hot copa seca, honey ham, serrano, Gruyère cheese, plump roasted tomatoes, olive oil and a hint of rosemary. Parsley flakes dot the crust of the bread, which is a scrumptious loaf of mini baguette.

Compared to The Godmother, The Spaniard is much easier to eat because it has less sauce and fewer toppings. Using olive oil instead of mustard and mayonnaise lets the flavors of the Gruyère, chorizo and serrano really shine. The nutty quality of the cheese and the strong, savory meat left my mouth watering. If you’re in the mood for a simpler sandwich than The Godmother and you want to satisfy all of your Spanish meat cravings, go for The Spaniard.

**The Little Don Lorenzo**

The Little Don Lorenzo is every bit as cute as its name. Served on a small, twisted mini baguette with olive oil and spicy black pepper seasoning, the tasty sandwich is made of thinly sliced, lace-like Parma prosciutto, water mozzarella, chopped basil and roasted tomato. It’s quintessentially Italian.

The mozzarella is a standout in this sandwich. The rich, smooth and creamy cheese complements the drier, more robust smoky flavor of the prosciutto. The basil adds a refreshing seasoning to the juicy roasted tomato.

The Little Don Lorenzo was more comparable to the simplicity of The Spaniard than the intensity of The Godmother. But the sandwich was comfort food – familiar flavors, a delectable combination of meat and cheese and just the right size for a little lunch.

Padilla said he still does not know all aspects of Bay Cities’ past. Parts of its long history are secret – and parts of its menu are as well.

The four ""off-the-menu"" items include ""The Godfather,"" a double-stacked version of The Godmother, ""The Don Lorenzo,"" an expansion of The Little Don Lorenzo served on the deli’s regular bread with caprese and Parma prosciutto, ""The Lt.,"" a sandwich with turkey and salami, and ""The Canine Nero,"" which includes tri tip, water mozzarella and balsamic vinegar and was named after a local police officer’s dog who died about a year after the officer became a regular at the deli.

Now when the officer and his pals come into the shop, they know to ask for The Canine Nero. And after nearly a decade of managing the store, Padilla loves that customers come to find sandwiches with personalities.

273,Raw Vegan Diaries: Tips and tricks from a foray with raw veganism,raw-vegan-diaries,Reporter Madeleine Wright breaks down what it was like being raw vegan for two weeks.,"[img184 fullwidth]

My brother and I sat at an elevated table in the corner of a shabby Mexican restaurant. I desperately tried to not focus on the plate of steak, rice and beans in front of him; I tried even harder to not compare it to the small bowl of guacamole – my meal – in front of me. I again reconsidered what I had set out to do for the two weeks: to be raw vegan. The fundamentals of raw veganism are simple: fruit, vegetables and nuts only, nothing prepared above 118 degrees, eat a lot to keep you full.

Two years previously, I failed at vegetarianism. This spring break and the first week of the quarter I wanted to push myself as far out of my comfort zone as I could and see what raw veganism is all about. A week into my experiment, although I was not ready to commit to raw veganism, I was considering it. What I had previously considered to be incomprehensible, I now felt had merit – because I felt great.

# The easy and the hard

## Easy

1. The fact that the only food preparation you need to do is rinse fruits and vegetables before you eat them.

2. Days 5-14: You’re used to it now, and when someone walks past you with a panini or piece of pizza, you don’t salivate and instead chew your raw almonds peacefully.

3. How surprisingly easy it is to feel full of energy and happy.

4. Your skin when you don’t have any animal byproducts in your diet. Butter – an animal byproduct – is greasy. When you remove it from your diet, everything you eat is “clean,” and your complexion improves.

## Hard

1. Going to In-N-Out and realizing that even though french fries are technically vegan, they are off-limits because they are prepared above 118 degrees.

2. The first four days. You’re constantly snacking to supplement your normal food cravings, and that makes you feel bloated and sluggish. Once you get the remnants of your old diet out of your system, your eating schedule normalizes and everything gets easier.

3. Having the staples of your diet be salad, fruit and nuts – and their many offshoots.

4. Not drinking coffee. Coffee beans are roasted (above 118 degrees).

5. Feeling cold. The cooking-temperature max of 118 degrees is not that hot – at best, it’s lukewarm. When everything you eat or drink is cold, your body stays chilly.

6. Eating at restaurants, dining halls or anywhere that’s not out of your fridge.

7. Trying to break up the monotony of raw carrots and apples by getting creative. Creativity when it comes to concocting appetizing food is also a struggle.

8. Not owning a blender.

# Trend

Mandie Clark is the Westwood Whole Foods’ raw vegan chef. She’s in charge of the pop-up raw venues that appear Monday to Thursday, 12-2 p.m. and 5-7 p.m. and she stocks the raw foods shelf inside the store with her raw creations. Her cart houses the essential ingredients and end results of her cooking: The walnuts help create her version of a hamburger and the sunflower seeds serve as her taco “meat.”

A raw vegan for seven years, Clark said she’s now made a career out of it. Two years ago, Clark was working at Whole Foods in Venice, where the concept for a raw vegan venue was born. Six months ago, she was hired in Westwood as the official raw chef, making the Westwood and Venice Whole Foods locations the only two on the West Coast with raw vegan venues, Clark said.

Many of the people who approach Clark have heard of veganism, but say they need meat in their diet for protein and variety, she said. Clark tells them they just need to eat more fruits and vegetables to get enough protein, and any supermarket has enough variety for a raw vegan. After that, the necessary tools are a blender, knife and a cutting board.

“It’s taking that first step that people are scared of,” Clark said. “They might know about the trend of raw veganism because it’s more popular, but it’s still only growing.”

She said the raw trend began in magazines around 2004, and there are now more people reading about it online and seeing raw snacks in stores. These can be found inside the Westwood Whole Foods – raw granola bars, raw goji berries and raw chips have their own shelf. Clark attributes the increase in snacks to customer demand. “If a customer wants raw food, Whole Foods is going to get it for them.”

# How to do it

## Eating on your own

When you become a raw vegan, the first few days are the hardest. You’ll be snacking a lot, and depending on where you live or what your food plan is, you’ll want to make sure you’re prepared. I recommend having the following foods at arm’s length because when you’re eating raw, hunger comes on fast and oftentimes without warning.

## Staples

Apples – Very filling and easy to carry around.

Bananas – Super sweet so you won’t crave as much and easy to carry around. Also great for smoothies (if you’re blessed with owning a blender).

Cherry tomatoes – Delicious, juicy and conveniently tiny.

Raw almonds – Perfect for snacking, lots of protein and they will fill you up.

Dried cherries and raisins – If you get bored of eating raw almonds alone (and you will), pair them with dried fruits to make your snack sweeter. Make sure no sweetener is added to the fruit.

Carrots (full-size, not baby) – They will keep you full and are perfect for when you’re starving and the only convenient dipping sauce you are allowed to eat is raw hummus. Get a 5-pound bag.

Tangerines – Sweet and easy to carry. You can eat a bunch at once and it will satisfy your sweet tooth.

Grapes – They will refresh you and are crunchy and cool enough that they’re a nice switch from the go-to apples and bananas.

Berries – Although they’re expensive, it’s not as though you’re eating meat or sushi, so splurge on berries, which have great antioxidants and help boost your metabolism (raspberries especially).

Sprouted mixed beans – High in protein and chewy. When you want something that reminds you of the black beans you used to get at Chipotle, this is a good option.

## Life savers

Avocados – High in oils and fats, and one of the only things you can eat that is not fresh off the vine and obnoxiously crunchy. When you’re tired of an apple, this is a great snack that you can complement with cold-pressed olive oil, lemon juice and a grapefruit. Put it on top of some butter lettuce and you’re golden.

Sprouted garbanzo bean hummus – Not only is this the only ready-made substantial condiment you have access to as a raw vegan, but it’s a wonderful addition to the myriad vegetables you’re eating and helps add a new dimension to plain produce. My favorite is Majestic Sprouted Hummus from Whole Foods for $5.99 a tub.

Cucumbers – Add lemon juice and salt. Delicious.

Red onions – Unlike the majority of vegetables you will be eating that are mild and boring after a while, onions are pungent.

Raw almond butter – After years of consuming peanut butter, this is not my personal favorite, but try it with apples and bananas.

## Nekter

I discovered Nekter Juice Bar, located at 10912 Lindbook Dr., in Westwood and thought I had found a Los Angeles-themed offshoot of Jamba Juice. A tall, bearded man behind the counter handed a customer a very green juice. Upon closer inspection of its menu, I realized that everything – including the granola in its acai bowls – was raw. Everything. UCLA students get 15 percent off with their BruinCard.

The Toxin Flush (parsley, spinach, apple, lemon and ginger): The ginger was pungent (a nice change for raw vegans) but the apple was sweet enough to counteract the vegetables and make it mild, manageable and delicious.

The Pitaya Bowl (pitaya, banana, pineapple, coconut butter and coconut water): The raw granola gave it a cereal-like crunch that I had craved for the preceding week, and it was thick and sweet. And it was substantial, something hard to come across when you’re a raw vegan.

Bruin Bowl (acai, banana, raw vanilla bean, cashew nut milk and berries): It was less thick and filling than the pitaya bowl, but the combination of the fruit, granola and acai gave it a depth that can oftentimes be missing from a raw vegan diet.

## Nutrionist

Carol Chen, a dietician at the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center, would not recommend an exclusively raw diet to a college student because of the time commitment and planning necessary to guarantee balanced nutrition. She would recommend a “cherry pick” – a combination of raw and cooked foods that still allows someone to experience the benefits of raw veganism.

She said that by eliminating animal byproducts from their diet, people would consume less saturated fat and cholesterol and have high levels of magnesium, potassium, calcium and vitamin C – all nutrients that are high in plants – in their systems.

But, she added that certain nutrient levels, like that of B-12, a nutrient found mainly in animal foods and a necessary component to make blood, can decrease. In the case of B-12, a lack of the nutrient can lead to anemia. Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are other examples of nutrients found mostly in fish sources that are essential and whose levels suffer in a raw vegan diet, Chen said. Protein and calcium are also hard to come by.

To combat this, Chen suggests eating complementary proteins, like legumes and grains, which also help increase iron levels. If consumed with vitamin C, the absorption of iron from plant sources is more effective, she added. Taking a protein supplement or nutritional yeast powders, which contain high amounts of B-12, help round out the nutrition in a raw vegan diet, Chen said.

# My feelings afterward

After two weeks as a raw vegan, my first non-vegan meal of potato soup seemed unnatural. I had a knot in my stomach from the guilt, and 20 minutes later, I had another knot in my stomach because of the ingredients. At first, I thought it was because of how rich they were, but the next day when I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the feeling returned. It wasn’t healthy and I knew the feeling was partly psychological.

Being a raw vegan had become my routine and, for those two weeks, it had become part of my identity, too. It had consumed me, and if I wasn’t eating raw – which I now equated with “healthy” – I felt guilty.

As I transitioned back to a “normal” diet, I continued to come back to this feeling, and it wasn’t until the fourth day that I could look at a pretzel and not question myself. Just two weeks earlier, I had the same type of transition, and within a week, I felt great. As a raw vegan, I had energy, I was happy and I felt healthy. But it was a transition. Raw vegan, vegan, vegetarian, carnivore – any lifestyle takes time to adapt to, and that adaptation partly consumes you. So maybe you are what you eat? Living the other way for two weeks taught me doing the extreme was great, but it also taught me I couldn’t do it forever.

However, the individuals who do go raw vegan – and stay raw vegan – aren’t following the same trend I was following. For them, it’s not a trend or a diet – it’s their actual lifestyle. To call it anything else would not reflect the difficulty in adhering to a diet so strict. I now know I would crave a chocolate chip cookie, or get tired of chewing carrots after too long.

What I won’t get tired of is balance. Once your body adapts, it’s part of who you are – now I eat pretzels, and thank goodness, because they’re delicious. But now I also drink green juice, and that’s delicious, too.","",8,,ARTICLE,5
274,"Point of Interest: Integrating acupuncture treatments, western medicine",point-interest,Starrie Lowe is an acupuncturist at the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness center who helps her patients heal from physical and emotional pains.,"A small red lampshade covers a single bulb, its light softening the sterile white paint of the small treatment room I’m sitting in.
A woman in a white lab coat slips through the doorway and sits in a swivel chair, scooting herself closer to me as I prepare to ask my first set of questions.

Starrie Lowe, who has been the acupuncturist at UCLA’s Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center for two years, is comfortable with getting up close and personal. Her career involves breaking through both bare skin and inhibition in an attempt to heal every kind of ache and pain. Lowe is a third generation acupuncturist, carrying on the traditions of what she calls a path toward health.

***

Acupuncture is based on the belief that humans have within them a map of energy pathways. The energy, or chi, responds to a needle that causes physiological shifts within the body, Lowe explained. For instance, the shifts can ease the swelling and pain of a sprained ankle or reduce stress.

There are also certain organs – such as the heart, liver and lungs – that are associated with negative emotions being out of balance.

She pulled out a piece of paper with an outline of a human body filled with branching lines and rivers of color from head to foot. It represented the flow of energy and showed the location of important needle points.

“I see the body as a canvas,” Lowe said.

[img129 fullwidth]

She added that acupuncture is much more than just the needles. It is also about encouraging patients to improve their individual lifestyles.

“I always welcome any questions my patients have. I have thousands of years of ancient medicine and storytelling for support,” Lowe said.

***

Lowe always knew she was going to be an acupuncturist.

Her mother and grandfather owned an acupuncture practice and she said the children in the family grew up with the understanding that this kind of medicine is a way of life.

When they got sick as children, they were given herbal teas and ginger cabbage soup instead of medications to chase their fevers away. There were always acupuncture tools lying around the house and she said that, even at a young age, she enjoyed getting acupuncture from her family.

“For me, it was as natural as breathing. I felt connected to my culture and heritage, which is still a reason why I am inspired by this career today,” Lowe said.

She volunteered in hospitals as a student because she said she always wanted to see how she could integrate Eastern medicine into a Western setting. Lowe finished the four-year program at Emperor’s College in Los Angeles in 1997, earning her degree as a licensed acupuncturist. A few years later, she began supervising acupuncture interns at the Ashe Center and eventually became the official staff acupuncturist.

Dr. David Baron, the executive director of the Ashe Center, said acupuncture was introduced at the center in response to student requests. Doctors also suggested offering the treatment because they wanted to suggest it as an additional treatment for their patients, he said. He added that the validity and usefulness of acupuncture was scrutinized just as any other Western treatment would be before being offered to students.

Baron said in his own experience as a physician, he has noticed a gradual trend toward mainstreaming Eastern medicine and a greater acceptance of the methods because people are becoming more frustrated with Western medicine.

Doctors who practice Western medicine have been subjected to many changes in the structure of the health care system that strain their relationship with the patient, Baron said.

“You might see the doctor for maybe five minutes, and he doesn’t even sit down but he gives you a prescription for your symptoms,” Baron said. “You might be getting what you need to feel better, but you don’t. You feel like you’re in a factory.”

Patients are allotted an hour of one-on-one contact with Lowe – an amount of individual attention that is rare in Western clinics.


Although students come into her office with physical sprains and aches, she said she finds that a broken spirit caused by emotional or mental stressors oftentimes contributes more to a person’s poor health.

Lowe said she has found that many patients seek acupuncture at the Ashe Center for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.

Although the actual acupuncture treatment only takes about 20 minutes, the appointment can naturally evolve into a session in which she listens to grievances about school and relationships.

She said that people tend to feel comfortable sharing private information with her, possibly because they feel like acupuncture’s goal is to treat the whole person.

The consultation sessions before and after the treatment are equally or even more important because she advises the patient on how to improve his or her well-being on a very personalized basis, Lowe said.

Chris Rusak, a third-year art history student, said he tried acupuncture years before coming to UCLA because bad experiences with prescription medication made him want to try something more natural. Since then, he tries to get the treatment regularly to treat pain and increase his overall health.

He said he recently sprained his ankle and Lowe’s acupuncture treatment immediately reduced the swelling and pain.

“I feel like a lot of doctors will give you medicine to treat one symptom, whereas acupuncture treats the body as a whole,” Rusak said. “That makes more sense to me.”

Lowe and other clinicians said that it is important to remember that acupuncture does not replace Western medicine but can complement a patient’s health care experience.

“For example, if you have a strong migraine, it makes sense for you to take medication. But if these migraines are reoccuring, it might be because of neck spasms that can be eased by acupuncture,” said Dr. Ka-Kit Hui, the director of the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine.

***

Toward the end of one of our interviews, Lowe stopped and said she had been answering too many questions, and now it was my turn. She asked how my health was doing.

Before I knew it, I had become one of her patients, confiding in her about my own anxieties and doubts.

She did not stick needles into my body, but somehow just the advice she gave me started to make me feel better.","",5,,ARTICLE,5
275,Receiving the Call: Former UCLA player Kevin Jordan finds new mission,receiving-call,"UCLA alumni and former student athletes Kevin Jordan and Jenny Johnson-Jordan return to campus as chaplains for UCLA athletes, bringing their journey full circle.","A group of about 30 UCLA student-athletes sits neatly on prearranged rows of chairs in a room in Pauley Pavilion. All eyes look ahead at football alumnus Kevin Jordan, who takes center stage.

Ephesians 2 is the topic for tonight’s meeting. It’s a part of the Bible that Jordan keeps close to his heart. In particular, verses eight through 10 – those were a few of the verses he first memorized as a young believer.

He gives a handout containing an interpretation of GRACE – God’s Riches At Christ’s Expense – and the gift of salvation, the same handout he received as a freshman at UCLA.

“I became a new man,” he says to the crowd of athletes, concluding his explanation on how the spiritual growth of his first year at UCLA changed him.

He looks into a crowd full of familiar faces that recognize how he and his wife, Jenny Johnson Jordan, have impacted UCLA Athletics through their roles as chaplains and life mentors.


# A new man

Kevin Jordan entered UCLA as a freshman in 1991 to play football and earn a degree. He graduated with a degree in sociology as an All-American and a UCLA career receiving yards and career receptions record breaker. He also left UCLA a better man.

He owed the latter to his mentor and football chaplain, Rod Hairston.

“Football was important, school was important, but balance was important for me and also my spiritual life,” Jordan said. “I really wanted to take some next steps and develop myself holistically, and our chaplain made himself available.”

As the team chaplain, Hairston would lead optional chapels for the football team. At the same time, he became Jordan’s guide through the unfamiliar world of college. Once a week, before practice, the two would sit inside an empty Pauley Pavilion to talk.

The topic was life; it could be about things that were going on at home or even about Jordan’s frustrations on the football field. Whatever the issue, Hairston would listen.

He wasn’t a coach determined to get the best out of a player. He wasn’t a teammate who wanted to work together to get the ""W."" He was a sympathetic ear whenever there were problems – he was a friend.

[img180 right]

“I knew that he was there to love me, to listen to me, to pray for me and to encourage me through my life,” Jordan said. “So that was really what got (me and my wife) started on this journey – the impact that people had in our lives as student athletes.”

Around the time of Jordan’s regular meetings with Hairston, there was a UCLA freshman volleyball player Jordan would often cross paths with. She lived in a nearby dormitory. They also had a class together. They even wore the same jersey numbers. But they never really knew each other at that point. That player was Jenny Johnson.

When they finally met a year later in 1992, it was through mutual friends. It didn’t take long for them to bond over what they shared in common, including Johnson having a spiritual and life mentor of her own in Natalie Nuce.

Their shared experience of having someone guide them spiritually would bring them together not only in marriage but also in an effort to continue the tradition of mentoring student athletes.

“The bottom line is I knew how much my life changed as a result of someone like myself being on campus, available for me to just share my life with,” Jordan said.

So they took the baton that Hairston and Nuce passed and ran with it.


# A home of their own

Jordan and Johnson Jordan never really left UCLA. Even after graduation, the duo would always come back to Westwood to visit old teammates and establish new relationships.

But at a certain point in their athletic careers, it was time for them to move on from Pauley Pavilion and the Rose Bowl.

Johnson Jordan traded the indoor courts for warm sand, making the transition from collegiate volleyball player to professional beach volleyball player.

Jordan, on the other hand, made his way up to the big leagues of football, signing with the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent. After half a season with the Cardinals and another half with the Cincinnati Bengals, Jordan found himself trying out for a third team, the Denver Broncos.

But after a training camp where he struggled with injury and ended up not making the cut, the newlyweds, who married during the 1997 offseason, decided to settle down in Los Angeles and focus on her dreams of going to the Olympics for beach volleyball.

“And so (it was) just like ‘you know what, be here in LA, this will be our base. You do what you do, and I’m here to support you,’” Jordan said.

With that, Jordan moved to their house in Los Angeles full time, no longer needing to be absent for months to travel with professional football teams.

One day while visiting UCLA, Jordan found the call he was looking for to the next chapter of his life.

When Hairston made the decision to move to a different ministry in 1998, Jordan’s experience made it seem like he was the natural person to step in and take Hairston's place.

When a former teammate reached out to him with the idea, it only took one session for Jordan to commit.

“Just being in that room that night, it was like a light bulb went off. I said ‘This is it; this is what I want to do,” he said.


# Trip East

Ten years into Jordan's career as a chaplain for the UCLA football team, a different opportunity came. 

Former UCLA football coach Karl Dorrell was released from the program. Since Jordan's position as chaplain was independent of UCLA Athletics and the team's leadership was changing, Jordan's position was no longer guaranteed. Then he received a call from the professional director of Athletes in Action, the athletic branch of Cru, with an offer to once again work in the NFL.

Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin had a vision for his team. He wasn't just looking for a team chaplain, he was looking for a family to integrate into the organization. That family would render spiritual services to players and coaches and also offer the same to significant others and children.

After initially wrestling with the decision to move on to new horizons, Jordan and Johnson Jordan decided to make the move to the Western Pennsylvania.

“It was a big faith decision for us to uproot after being in Southern California for so many years,” Jordan said. “But we really felt like in a strange way, this was a call for us to step out in faith and to go and serve in this particular role.”

The new experience came with new duties. Jordan would have to be a figure present in the locker room and at the sidelines. He would also hold Bible studies for the players and coaches. Meanwhile, Johnson Jordan would hold studies for the players’ and coaches’ wives and girlfriends. They’d even work together to conduct couple studies.

“I felt like, because we had that background of professional sports, we could obviously relate to them in some degree,” Johnson Jordan said.

The new experience with the Steelers was enough to entice them to stay a year more than they had initially committed. But at the end of the day, even with two trips to the Super Bowl, they wanted to come back to Westwood.

The process of returning to Los Angeles started with Cori Close’s hiring as coach of the UCLA women’s basketball team.

“When I had my press conference here, Jenny’s (Johnson Jordan) father, UCLA alumnus Rafer Johnson, was there,” Close said. “And he came right up to me after the press conference and says ‘Okay, now you have a job to do. Now you have to help me get Jenny back here to LA. ... I miss my grandbabies.’”

Close, who had known Johnson Jordan since their days of regular Tuesday lunches in 1994 and 1995, was able to convince Johnson Jordan to come back to the West Coast.


# Coming Home

It was the same UCLA, but this time was different.

The four years Jordan and Johnson Jordan spent in Pittsburgh meant that almost all the student-athletes the couple had built relationships with before coming back in 2012 had already graduated.

They had to begin the slow process of getting to know a new generation of student-athletes once again. This time, they would serve the community as the 4TheJourney ministry, a donation-run ministry named after the number the couple shared on the back of their jerseys during their UCLA athletic careers.

[img181 fullwidth]

They started anew, as the women's basketball chaplains. It was an opportunity that gave them a foot into the door of the lives of student-athletes.

“These kinds of opportunities just gave us more opportunities to get to know the student-athletes of today,"" Jordan said. ""Where I can see one of the girls walking around, I know who she is, I know her name and they know what we do on campus.”

From Close’s perspective, working with Jordan and Johnson Jordan was the right answer to giving her players a valuable resource that she had access to when she was a student-athlete. She wanted her players to have the option of talking to what she calls a “trustworthy, wise outside source that they could really lean on.”

When tragedy struck the UCLA Athletics community in September 2013 with the untimely passing of former football wide receiver Nick Pasquale, Close recommended Jordan to UCLA football coach Jim Mora. Jordan once again took on the role of spiritual leader of UCLA football.

“They needed someone who was close enough to the guys, that looked like the guys, that could relate to the guys, in their time of need,” Close said. “I told Coach Mora about Kevin and how Kevin’s one of their own – I mean, he’s a UCLA football guy.”

""Both Jenny and Kevin were Bruins, so they know the culture of this school, (the athletes) know they know dorm life, (the athletes) know they know the cafeteria, (the athletes) know they know all the ins and outs around here and have seen the change,” said Mike Buchanan, who works with Athletes in Action.

“That gives them a pretty good platform around here, and a lot of the coaches have a lot of respect for them too and that’s opened a lot of doors to help them do what they’ve been called to.”


# The new generation

Now, a year and a half removed from Jordan and Johnson Jordan's return to UCLA, the 4TheJourney ministry has become an integral part of the UCLA athletic community.

Two years ago, Jordan and Johnson Jordan formed a relationship with junior guard Madeline Brooks as team chaplains but, after working together for two seasons, her relationship with the couple has developed into something much more than what it started off as.

Now Jordan is scheduled to officiate the wedding between Brooks and her fiance, sophomore pitcher Cody Poteet.

“He has a younger daughter. In the way he treats his daughter, he just respects her and cares for her in a very special way,” Brooks said. “He does that in a similar light to us.”

Every day they continue to work toward impacting a new generation of athletes the same way their mentors once did them.

“They're not overly bearing about Bible, Bible. You can really relate to them too and they’re really easy to talk to about any situation, even about relationships or about your sport, because they both were athletes here too so they get it,” said women’s soccer junior defender Caprice Dydasco, who sought advice on juggling a busy student-athlete life from the couple not long ago.

Though they still don’t officially hold a position in UCLA Athletics, or even have an office, Jordan and Johnson Jordan's ""ministry of presence"" can still regularly be seen around Westwood, whether it’s at games, practices or even just outside the Acosta Athletic Complex, having a chat with student-athletes.

[img182 fullwidth]

The figurative doors to the 4TheJourney ministry are always open for any athletes who may need someone to counsel them. It doesn't matter if what they want to talk about is spiritual or personal.

As he steps into Acosta, Jordan jokes that this would be the place for a hypothetical office if he had one – it’s where the foot traffic is, he says.

277,Letter from the Editors,letter-editors,Letter from the Editors,"Dear readers,

Every school year is an evolution, a process of growth and learning. Sure, as college students, much of our studying is done in classrooms and libraries, the typical facilitators of education.

But college is far more than reading information off a page. Our time as undergraduates is spent in a process of self-discovery, of adaptation, progress, transformation and, ultimately, change.

And with another school year come and gone, that change is very much at the heart of this issue of prime.

From the challenges that transgender students face every day, to the evolution of movie theater culture in Los Angeles, to the shifting laws surrounding street cart vending and undocumented immigrants, each story is emblematic of prime's broader progression.

Over the course of this year, we've grown and changed as a magazine, honing our style and our tone, working to evolve our message.

But now it's time for us, as editors, to say goodbye. To pass on our version of prime to a new generation, who will help it continue to shine brightly.

Thank you for taking this journey with us. We will miss prime terribly.

Love,

279,A Bright Idea: Turning old light bulbs into decorative vases,bright-idea,Transform burnt-out lightbulbs into vases in seven easy steps. ,"[img132 fullwidth]

# Essentials

1. Thick gloves
2. Safety goggles
3. Long-nose pliers (the narrower the better)
4. Screwdriver
5. Old light bulb
Note: Do not use fluorescent light bulbs as they may release toxic chemicals when broken. 

# Recommended

1. String 
2. Hammer
3. Small, thin piece of metal (IKEA Allen wrenches are great)

[img138 fullwidth]

# Instructions

1. Put on safety gear and find a safe, open area. Very small glass particles will fly into the air, so an easily cleaned surface, like a towel, is necessary.
2. Use the pliers to peel off the little metal covering on the tip of the light bulb, revealing a small hole in the black plastic. [img133 fullwidth]
3. Wedge the point of the screwdriver into the little hole to break the black plastic. [img134 fullwidth]
4. Use the pliers to remove the now-cracked black plastic so you have access to the inside of the light bulb. 
5. Break the miniature bulb within the light bulb using a combination of the pliers, screwdriver, hammer and small metal piece. Recommended: Hammer with the small metal piece until the miniature bulb breaks, and then use the screwdriver and pliers to chisel away the remaining glass by twisting them at an angle within the neck of the bulb. [img135 fullwidth]
6. Use the pliers to pull out the wiring, leaving behind a clean, empty light bulb. [img137 fullwidth]
7. Add water and flowers and hang by a string.

280,Who are the Urinals?,who-are-urinals,Meet the Urinals. These UCLA punk rockers still making music over 30 years after graduating.,"[img303 fullwidth]

The Thursday night crowd at Pasadena’s Old Towne Pub is small, but the sound pounding out of the opening band’s amps is deafening.

As the band plays its final discordant notes, a few more guests trickle in and order drinks at the bar.

Before handing the stage over, the opening act asks the crowd, “Who’s here to see the Urinals?”

Some family and friends applaud as Kevin Barrett, Rob Roberge and John Talley-Jones transition onto the stage.

“Apparently these guys are historical figures or something,” says a guest, leaning over. “I've never heard of them.”

[spotify]5g9utKqn0nJQr1MVvGbVCy[/spotify]

The Urinals began as a punk rock parody act during a UCLA Dykstra Hall talent show in the spring of 1978.

Five students came together with toy instruments, little-to-no prior music experience and only four to five practices under their belts to entertain their fellow floormates.

“We wanted to do two things: participate and subvert,” said Talley-Jones, the Urinals' vocalist and bassist. “We created a band specifically to be as assaultive – given our lack of chops – as possible.”

While some musicians from other acts weren't amused, most of the audience was in on the joke and appreciated the performance.

[img292 fullwidth]

The response was positive enough to encourage the group members to pursue punk rock and actually learn how to play and write their own music.

Three of the original five members stuck with the ragtag band and went into the summer of '78 with the intention of writing original punk material.

In the late '70s, the punk rock scene was less stagnant than it is now – the genre itself was still in infancy, and the scene wasn't associated with a specific sound yet. Punk, particularly on the West Coast, was still finding its shape.

“In those early days, everything was evolving,” Talley-Jones said.

Talley-Jones, drummer Barrett and guitarist Kjehl Johansen were searching for the band’s own shape as well, which would continue to change and adapt alongside the genre itself.

[spotify]7vehOyii6F4CtFjsF24IhQ[/spotify]

Halloween of 1978 was a fateful day for the Urinals.

Back from summer break and equipped with original material, the three students were ready to perform again. All they needed was an audience.

Their chance came during a Halloween party in Dykstra Hall. Every floor was hosting its own holiday activity, and the Urinals volunteered to have a concert in the fourth-floor study lounge.

The new songs were a bit rough and musically limited, but their length – short, a minute or two maximum – laid a framework that the band still follows.

“It’s an aesthetic choice. We wanted to write material that was geared to our limited abilities. It was one idea per song, stated efficiently in a brief amount of time. And then you’re done with that, and you move on to the next thing,” Talley-Jones said.

While the fourth-floor lounge was hardly an acoustic ideal, the band's performance still managed to stand out to one very important guest.

Vitus Mataré was in the audience, and he immediately took interest in the student band.

Mataré was the keyboard player for The Last, a band that had recently begun to gain popularity in the punk scene after being signed by Bomp Records.

To the surprise of the Urinals, Mataré eagerly offered to help record the band's first single at his pool house. The three members took the offer and, in do-it-yourself fashion, got the records pressed and distributed under their own label, Happy Squid Records.

Soon, the records began to make their way from punk fan to punk fan, even reaching the East Coast. But making a record didn’t spawn instant popularity – some listeners responded with confusion, even derision.

One response, from a listener in Florida, stood out: “Your record is about as musical as a dial tone ... or a pneumatic drill.”

[img293 fullwidth]

Despite some criticism, the record helped spread the band’s music, and those first few original recordings would eventually become the first four songs on ""Negative Capability,"" the Urinal’s first complete album.

With a single circulating, the Urinals began playing in UCLA venues like Kerckhoff Coffeehouse and practicing in parking lots and classrooms across campus.

The Urinals even crossed paths with an unhappy Chancellor Charles E. Young, who interrupted a practice in the Dickson Art Center (now the Broad Art Center) to let the band know it was echoing through Brentwood and into his house.

The band was also banned from playing at Ackerman Grand Ballroom after someone urinated in the grand piano after a show. The suspiciously named band was blamed despite its absence during the incident.

The band soon broke out of the UCLA scene and into Hollywood with help from Mataré.

The Urinals made their way along the Sunset Strip, opening for The Last as well as other significant early punk bands like Black Flag and even local favorites like the Go-Go’s.

The band quickly contributed more than just music to the scene, helping other fledgling bands it stumbled upon, like the Leaving Trains, play their first shows.

“Vitus did that for us, so that's what you’d do for other bands,” Barrett said.

Soon, Talley-Jones said, those bands had formed a microculture of their own.

[spotify]72oVzWeLswz2nPHmGE2LEV[/spotify]

As their sound evolved, the Urinals began to take issue with the image their name evoked.

“It seemed at that point that (the name) was starting to box us in. By the early '80s, everyone heard 'the Urinals’ and thought we were hardcore, but we were not hardcore,” Barrett said.

[img208 right]

The band soon changed its name to 100 Flowers in hopes of cultivating a new, broader image. The members stayed the same, but the music was more put together, with better songwriting and production.

A self-titled album was produced in 1983 with 16 songs – still short, but with a more sophisticated sound.

Unfortunately, the band split up a month before the album was released, citing creative differences. So despite its positive reception, there was no one to take the music forward.

[img197 right]

The individual members followed their own paths for 13 years and eventually decided to reunite, returning to the original ""Urinals"" name in 1996. The original lineup remained intact until Johansen left two years later. After a brief stint with an interim guitarist, the band filled the vacancy with a new guitarist, Rob Barker.

Barker, the guitarist on the band’s third album ""What is Real and What is Not,"" stayed until 2005 but left after the group returned from playing in a music festival in Beijing.

With the band once again missing a guitarist, Rob Roberge, a friend Barrett made after taking one of Roberge’s creative writing classes through UCLA Extension, expressed interest in playing with the Urinals. After some experimentation, the band started performing again and has maintained this lineup since 2006.

[spotify]61C5jhoGbczXIvjkrn7Siz[/spotify]

Each of the band’s three albums represents a different slice of its musical style – each showing a new evolution of its sound.

""Negative Capability,"" the first album, shows the early music – the songs themselves evolve over the course of the album. With so little musical knowledge back then, the band seemed to learn something new with every recording session.

The sound also evolved, simply because of changes in studio venue. The first set of songs was recorded with poor quality in Mataré’s pool house, the next at a Melnitz Hall sound studio and the last at a weight room in Dykstra Hall, the sound booming and the noise of one student still working out in the background.

""100 Flowers,"" the second album, illustrates a more musically capable slice of the band, each song having a more refined melody and rhythm, Talley-Jones said.

""What is Real and What is Not,"" the third album, was made after Johansen left the band and Barker took his place.

The fourth album – whose name is currently a secret – is set to come out in early 2015.

“Their sound has never stayed the same and it has always been unique. The band is always progressing and evolving,” said Danny Gromfin of Warning Label Records, who helped issue some of the band’s albums in collaboration with Happy Squid Records.

[spotify]31UUgJiklGiBjDl2R8yQde[/spotify]

Yo La Tengo, Butthole Surfers and the Minutemen are only a few of the names on a list Kathy Talley-Jones – John’s wife – keeps of the bands that have covered the Urinals’ songs.

[img205 right]

“We are constantly finding new covers out there,” Gromfin said. Gromfin keeps a similar list and exchanges names with Kathy Talley-Jones whenever a new cover pops up.

The names, spanning through genres and generations, show the influence that the band has on the L.A. music scene and music in general.

Although the band was one of many playing in Los Angeles in the late '70s and early '80s, its songwriting and music stood out to audiences and encouraged other bands to start and produce their own music, Gromfin said.

The age of the Internet also helped the band reach newer generations and kept its influence growing.

“A peculiar thing started to happen,” John Talley-Jones said. “We were discovered by subsequent generations of bands and people started to hear the material from back then. They found something resonant in the material that they really liked.”

This resurgence has even given the band the opportunity to tour internationally.

The band has toured in Canada and China because people heard its music and wanted the band to play at festivals or shows in their own countries, Talley-Jones said.

The Urinals’ latest tour was in Europe, where a fan and manager of London-based record label Harbinger Sound, Steve Underwood, set up the entire tour. The band played in France and Belgium in early November.

[img214 centered]

[spotify]3xtnvQAs5a1ArSl3WNameX[/spotify]

Rather than chase big contracts, the band members chose to take other jobs and pursue music without the pressure of it becoming a substantial career.

“We wanted to be able to play the songs we wanted and record them when we wanted. If that meant we had to have jobs, then we would have jobs,” Barrett said.

Each band member has his own career.

Talley-Jones was the medical book buyer at the UCLA Health Sciences Store for the past 12 years, though he retired a few months back. Barrett has been a data manager for an AIDS research study within the UCLA School of Public Health for the last 30 years, and Roberge is an author and creative writing professor at UC Riverside.

The choice to pursue more typical, nine-to-five careers was occasionally a source of frustration for the band members – keeping their performances and day jobs separate wasn’t easy.

“We had to juggle the band with our careers. You go on tour and then you come back to your cubicle,” Talley-Jones said. “You’re idolized for two weeks and then suddenly you’re just another cog in the wheel.”

But work was another aspect that defined the group.

“I think working has kept us honest, and it keeps things in perspective,” Talley-Jones added. “We know that this band is never going to be a multiplatinum selling act. That’s not why we do it. We do it because we love it.”","",4,,ARTICLE,6
281,prime City Guide: Venice,prime-city-guide-venice,"prime takes you inside another local enclave — Venice Beach —  for the best shopping, eating, and sightseeing the neighborhood has to offer","[img302 fullwidth]

Venice, Calif., has a reputation that transcends continents.

The only other “famous” Venice besides the original one in Italy, the two places share little resemblance other than a series of canals and the ability to attract celebrities.

But there is much more to Venice than merely the skater-filled boardwalk or the body builders that line Muscle Beach.

The only Westside haven for the weird, Venice stands out on this side of town as the funky, younger cousin of preppy Brentwood and Santa Monica.

Venice is an amalgam of several cities. The chic homes that dot the canals seem a world away from the trendy boutiques of Abbot Kinney Boulevard, and both stand in sharp contrast to the city’s boardwalk, with its vibrant street artists, henna tattoos and dozens of pipe shops. Venice is high-end, grungy – elite, but also very warm.

In effect, Venice is representative of Los Angeles as a whole – a mishmash of people, economic classes, desires and opportunities. In Venice, the Range Rover moms eat at the same mom-and-pop pizza joints as the surfer dudes.

As always, prime is here to offer you the best that this neighborhood enclave has to offer. Take a Sunday and explore – you won't be sorry.

-----

[img258 centered]

### **THE BOARDWALK**

No trip to Venice would be complete without visiting the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Take a stroll along the beach and watch rollerbladers, skaters and body builders enjoy the sun and the surf.

The Boardwalk itself is littered with small stands selling everything from postcards to dream catchers to paintings, though there are a few true stores.

One such brick-and-mortar highlight is Small World Books. Nestled next to The Sidewalk Café, near the back, Small World Books is a sight for sore eyes. As the number of independent bookstores continues to dwindle in Los Angeles, Small World Books is a relic of a time gone by. Quaint and jam-packed with everything from bestsellers to artsy 'zines, Small World is as charming as it is well-priced.

[img262 left]

Even better, the bookstore houses a librarian cat – Conan – who can be spotted lounging in various parts of the store. With its coziness and charm, Small World Books is a welcome respite from the people-packed and intense boardwalk.

Just off the Boardwalk, at the corner of Windward Avenue and Pacific Avenue, there are a number of other charming shops and restaurants.

Check out local favorite Mao’s Kitchen for standout Chinese “country-style” food. Not to mention, their menu is amusing, offering options like “Peace not war wonton” soup ($8) and “Model citizen noodle soup” ($9). Café Collage next door is a good place to stop for a specialty latte or pastry, and they’re reasonably priced too.

Word to the wise: On the actual boardwalk, watch out for scamming street performers as well as people inviting you into medicinal marijuana doctor recommendation shops – they’re perfectly safe, but aggressive.

[img255 centered]

### **ABBOT KINNEY**

Abbot Kinney Boulevard is the heart of trendy Venice, a collection of just-eclectic-enough boutiques and restaurants that the Westside rich can feel grungy without having to actually drive over to Silver Lake.

That being said, Abbot Kinney is still a delight. While the street does play host to a number of bars and restaurants, the two standout places to grab a bite aren’t restaurants at all.

Intelligentsia Coffee, with locations across the city, has long been considered the best coffee in town, and that fact remains true at the Venice location. However, it’s the store’s chic industrial ambience that makes it a catch, plus the wealth of seating. Order a cappuccino and a pastry, and sit down to write your screenplay like everyone else is pretending to.

[img256 right]

Across the street and down the block is N’iceCream, a charming storefront selling freshly made gelato and sorbet. While the flavors change on a daily basis, standouts include the stracciatella and hazelnut (made with real Nutella). Stop by for a cone or a cup on a hot day and take a rest on the charming rustic benches inside.

While most of the boutiques are hideously overpriced, they can be fun for window-shopping.

Bountiful is one such shop. While the inside is lined floor to ceiling (literally) with antique glassware and china that is priced out of any college student’s range, the sidewalk sale bins are a treasure trove. You’ll find colorful mason jars and other home goods on the cheap, stacked next to buckets of seashells, sold by the scoop.

Abbot Kinney also plays host to a number of high-end art galleries that are scattered along the busy street. Take a look inside C.A.V.E. Gallery if you have a minute to glance at some truly forward-thinking art, or just take a breather and sip your coffee in peace while enjoying something new.

[img261 centered]

### **OFF THE BEATEN PATH**

There is much more to Venice than just Abbot Kinney or the Boardwalk.

Start with Superba Snack Bar. The Italian-esque eatery is open and adorable, with edgy tile work and communal tables. While the food is top-notch regardless of what time of day you stop by, the brunch menu will afford the most bang for your buck.

[img254 left]

We recommend the veggies and eggs (sunny-side up eggs, kale pesto, fingerling potatoes, broccolini, pecorino and caramelized onions, $16) or the potato and rosemary waffle (ham, poached egg and mornay, $14). If you’re looking for something particularly great, try the crispy French toast ($15). Made of brioche with a side of berries and chantilly cream, the French toast is sweet and crunchy, but it’s the unique texture of the side of buttered syrup that will take you by surprise.

Another important stop is the Venice Canals. These narrow waterways, reminiscent of the original ones in Italy, are an inlet from the Pacific. They’re quite shallow and are dotted with homes, most of which have a little boat and dock in the yard for a watery jaunt. Take a walk along the banks or cross over one of the many bridges for a charming view. The Dell Avenue bridges are a good place to start.

-----

Parking tips: Bring cash if you’re planning to park anywhere near the Boardwalk, as street parking is exceptionally limited and most lots only take cash. Parking on Abbot Kinney is varied – there is some street parking on the actual boulevard, but there are also public lots behind the stores where you can try your luck. For the canals, park on any of the nearby side streets.

283,Writing on the Wall,writing-wall,Inside the fight to re-legalize and save Los Angeles’ public art in the nation’s mural capital.,"[img305 fullwidth]

For more than a decade, all new murals painted on private property in the city of Los Angeles were illegal.

And then a year ago – with a simple vote from City Hall – they weren’t.

From 2002 until 2013, a signage moratorium that governed public advertisements left most murals in Los Angeles in a legal limbo.

The moratorium was enacted in response to the proliferation of large works on private property, which aimed to sell commercial products.

In 2003, Los Angeles moved to ban these advertisements, which were passing under the guise of art, but complaints by sign companies led the city to simply ban all signage on city walls, which included murals.

The controversy came down to a single paragraph in the city code that classified murals as equivalent to advertisements and billboards, banning them all, full stop.

[img236 centered]

Artists across the city mainly ignored the moratorium, preferring to keep the politics out of their painting. It was only after completed, older murals came under attack from whitewashers that muralists began to band together to fight the law.

“It was the first time I really saw the Los Angeles muralists and public art community come together like that,” said artist Kristy Sandoval.

In order to get around the limiting regulation, artists often used loopholes in the language of the moratorium, doing things like painting on schools, which often had protected status as city property.

In 2011, as a result of the whitewashing outcry, the Los Angeles City Council commissioned a Mural Working Group that consisted of artists, gallery owners and the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles to help develop a new ordinance to govern murals in the city.

[img233 right]

Dozens of meetings between stakeholders were held to determine exactly how to split the city’s definition between an original art mural and a public advertisement.

Even with overwhelming support from the public art community and city councilmembers, the creation of the committee was only the beginning of a months-long process to push the ordinance through city bureaucracy.

On Aug. 28, 2013, with a vote of 13-2, a new ordinance governing the state of murals in the City of Los Angeles was approved.

At the forefront of the charge for the mural ordinance was Isabel Rojas-Williams, executive director of the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles. For her, the right to public art is particularly personal. She left her home in Chile during the 1970s to escape persecution, and possible execution, for painting political slogans on public walls.

------

The current mural ordinance contains two distinctions that classify the type of murals depending on when they were painted.

Murals painted before the advent of the 2013 mural ordinance were grandfathered in and given official status. Iconic pieces, such as the Victor Clothing Company's murals in the historic area of downtown or ""Cream of the Crop"" in the Arts District, are now supposed to be legally sanctioned.

Murals painted after the passage of the ordinance would be eligible for a permit that would give the artwork protected status for at least two years.

While these newly installed pieces are subject to a variety of rules and restrictions, some artists are arguing that the updated system limits their freedom of expression.

[img243 left]

An email from Felicia Filer, the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs Public Art Division director, said the response to the permitting system has been varied, but some artists have found it easy.

Yet Sandoval, who painted the first mural to receive official permitting under the new rules by the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs, disagrees.

She said she thinks her piece, “Keep Pacoima Beautiful,” which is situated on the corner of Glenoaks and Van Nuys boulevards in Pacoima, was a mess of bureaucratic entanglements.

Currently, in order to obtain an official mural permit from the city, applicants must complete the following process.

First, an artist with a mural idea contacts the Department of Cultural Affairs to get the mural registration materials.

After receiving the materials, the permit applicant is required to set up a community meeting to communicate to the larger community the significance of the mural.

Once the community meeting has been held and approval by the building owner and the local neighborhood council is received, the permit applicant sends in the registration materials along with a $60 fee.

If the department approves the mural, the artist is then given the go-ahead to paint or install the artwork, after which they submit more documents for a final review by the Department of Cultural Affairs.

[img235 right]

Simply listing all the steps, however, doesn’t really reveal the time and financial cost of the process, Sandoval said.

For example, the $60 permitting fee doesn’t reveal the $40 filing fee with the city and the cost of installing the required anti-graffiti coating.

Sandoval said she paid out of pocket for all costs associated with “Keep Pacoima Beautiful,” including hundreds of dollars to install anti-graffiti coating on the work.

She added that applying for a permit also takes a large amount of time – she said she thinks multiple visits to government agencies can be a bureaucratic nightmare, and logistical elements, like finding a building’s ultimate property owner, can be challenging and stressful.

[img240 centered]
[img296 right]

However, Sandoval said that despite the permitting headache, she still sees the importance of guaranteeing her mural’s protection.

“It’s more for everyone else, not for my ego,” she said. “It’s important to register the murals because I want to make sure that it has a lasting impact on the community.”

Still, Sandoval admits that the hassle of applying for a permit has probably dissuaded some artists from trying to protect their work.

In the year since the passage of the new mural ordinance, fewer than 50 mural applications have been received. Of that number, only a handful have been officially registered, according to numbers obtained from the Department of Cultural Affairs.

[img295 left]

Besides the long process for getting the mural registered, another criticism of the ordinance is that it hampers the creative freedom of the artist.

Sandoval said because the process involves getting the design approved in advance by city officials, it stops her from making any last-minute changes while painting the work.

“It restricts me from having a moment of inspiration,” Sandoval said. “When I’m painting, I don't want to have to have that inspiration stopped.”

In the year since the passage of the original ordinance, the city has also made some changes to the law that pertain to protecting installed murals and opening up the number of walls available for artists.

[img237 left]

An amendment to the mural ordinance brought forward in May aimed to address the fact that many property owners are unfamiliar with the bureaucratic process.

Previous to the May amendment, some property owners were hit with notices of noncompliance, even if the murals on their property were going through the application process. As a result, the fear of the thousands of dollars in fines that could be levied led to the whitewashing of ostensibly protected works by the property owners.

The amendment attempted to fix this unnecessary action by giving property owners the proper information regarding the notices and how to move forward legally.

The ordinance has also provided an option for some councilmembers to opt into allowing murals on single-family homes in their district.

------

Critics’ main arguments for overturning the mural moratorium were twofold. One, a new ordinance was needed to protect the city’s artistic history, and two, any observer would be able to tell the difference between a sign and a mural.

With a history going back more than half a century, murals in Los Angeles are well-integrated into the city’s cultural landscape. Recent events, however, have shown the distinction between artwork and advertising may be less obvious than originally anticipated.

[img231 centered]

With a good dose of human drama, the most publicized of these conflicts involves a controversial public art figure, an indie rock band and the mayor of Los Angeles.

The battleground for the summer’s biggest conflict over public art now lays bare. A plain white wall overlooks a nondescript lot in downtown that housed hundreds of screaming, selfie-taking fans just a few months ago.

A massive mural for the band Foster the People on the side of the Santa Fe Lofts was painted in January in advance of the release of the band’s album, “Supernatural.”

The mural featured artwork from the album’s cover and measured 125 feet high. The process for painting the mural had been used in a music video for the album track, “Coming of Age.”

Foster the People announced that the city was going to paint over the mural in July, citing improper permitting and the definition in the mural ordinance that prohibits advertisements as part of the mural.

The band appealed to its fans for help, and a social media campaign to save the mural began. Dozens of comments flooded L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Instagram account, and an online petition garnered more than 12,000 signatures.

“Don’t call it a mural – it’s a sign,” said Rojas-Williams. “The vast majority of these people were fans of the band. They had no idea between the difference of the sign and a legitimate work of art.”

[img285 right]

Spurred on by the attention, Garcetti came in and contacted the building owner and mediated a temporary stay for the mural. During this cooling-off period, the band hosted a celebration at the site of the mural, giving out free posters and merchandise to fans.

The reprieve was short-lived.

In August, Garcetti released a joint statement with the band and the building owner informing the public that the work was to be painted over.

Mere weeks after the announcement that the mural was saved, the entire side of the building was whitewashed.

[img239 left]

Daniel Lahoda, founder of the L.A. Freewalls Project, an organization which aims to connect muralists with willing property owners, organized and helped to paint the mural, which was one of the largest in California.

The city said the mural violated the structure’s status as a historic building, but Lahoda contends that it was simply a way to limit artists’ freedom of expression.

“It was really kind of backhanded, the way the city did it,” Lahoda said. “They wanted to create this narrative that we were putting this big billboard up to try and bamboozle the community.”

East Los Angeles-based artist Sonia Romero, who often works with governments and corporations to install murals, said it's up to artists to uphold their own ethical principles.

“I think it's okay to have the sponsorship of a large company, but it's up to an artist to negotiate to have the freedom of expression,” Romero said.

While Lahoda remains a divisive figure in the L.A. public and street art community, he had some choice words for the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles and the way the mural ordinance was being administered.

[img242 right]

He labeled the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles and artists like Romero and Sandoval as compliant to the bureaucratic system, which he views as opposing the counter-cultural mission of murals themselves.

“When it comes to getting art on the wall, there’s a certain amount of preferential treatment, depending on how compliant the artist may or may not be,” Lahoda said.

Lahoda, who in his capacity as a founder of the L.A. Freewalls Project was part of the Mural Working Group, said his organization pioneered many of the steps now used for official permitting, including holding community meetings.

Although he said the mural ordinance was important in overturning the moratorium, Lahoda said he thinks the way the ordinance is being administered – which drives up cost and time commitments for artists – is actually deterring muralists from protecting their own art.

“Until the law reflects the spirit of the community and the spirit of the ordinance and the spirit of the art as a tool for social change, we’ll continue to butt heads,” Lahoda said. “We’re not anti-ordinance, we’re anti-fascism.”

------

Ironically, some of the first murals came to Los Angeles in partnership with the government – the Works Project Administration, a New Deal project, paid for murals to go up in and around government property as a way of offering jobs to artists in the opportunity-starved Great Depression.

In the year since the passage of the mural ordinance and the overturning of the moratorium, public spectacle and political grandstanding has often overshadowed the original intention of the art.

But even while conflict rages over the role of regulation in public art, a singular sentiment can be heard over the din of debate – the belief that murals act as catalysts for social change.

“A mural is a mirror,” Rojas-Williams said. “Murals are abrasive precisely because they speak to all the issues that affect us in society. They add a voice to the voiceless on the walls of Los Angeles.”","",5,,ARTICLE,6

285,Meet Me on the Metro,meet-me-metro,Ryan Nelson teaches his tips and tricks for making the most out of LA’s Metro rail.,"[img307 fullwidth]

There are two things that have come to define Los Angeles’ trajectory as a city: water and transportation.

More so than the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, the idyllic beaches or the perpetually sun-kissed weather, it’s these two factors that have contributed the most in molding Los Angeles into the metropolis it is today.

Los Angeles’ deep – and sometimes parasitic – relationship with water is known history at this point. The story of a self-taught engineer and famous street name recipient William Mulholland blazing his way across the vast California desert to siphon off water from Owens Valley has already cemented itself in Angeleno lore.

But there’s another history at play here, and it’s one that doesn’t get as much airtime. Once upon a time, car-mad Los Angeles was very much a train town, with a bustling Union Station and more than 1,000 miles of above-ground streetcars.

[img244 fullwidth]

After World War II, an inverse relationship between what Americans wanted and what streetcars provided became evident: The system buckled under the weighty (but eventually costly) convenience of the automobile, and in 1963 was dismantled fully.

Los Angeles would go 27 years without anything but buses, until the Blue Line, which ran along some of the former trolley car routes and connected downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach, opened in 1990.

Metro, Los Angeles’ public transit agency, was founded that same year and has since had to deal with a myriad of complaints.

But as a city obsessed with movies should know, reality and representation don’t always match.

To find out once and for all what Metro was all about, I gave myself a distinct challenge over the summer: three months, using only one tank of gas. I bought a $50 unlimited Metro card, and spent my next 90 days riding buses and rails to and from work, school and play.

What follows is a breakdown of my experience on the Metro – the best lines, stops and places – all of which are just a quick train ride away.

[img290 fullwidth]

The Red Line was Los Angeles’ first – and up until this year – last attempt at building a comprehensive subway system. The line is the sole train line connecting the Los Angeles Basin with its suburban counterpart in the San Fernando Valley, and thus remains one of Metro’s busiest lines.

The nearest station to UCLA is the Hollywood/Highland station, which is accessible by taking the 2/302 bus down Sunset Boulevard directly to Highland Avenue and walking two blocks north. It’s an area rich with Hollywood history, including the TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman’s Chinese Theatre) and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Hop on the line and head south, toward Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. Along the way, get off at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, where you’ll find a quick two-block walk to Amoeba Music, one of Los Angeles' most famous record stores. Inside, you’ll find a near-impenetrable labyrinth of collectable vinyl, CDs and merchandise that range from oldies to indies.

Past this, the Westlake/MacArthur Park station offers a glimpse of one Los Angeles' prettiest parks, and it usually has a flea market running parallel to it.

At the Pershing Square station, it’s a short walk to the Walt Disney Concert Hall, City Hall and the Grand Central Market. City Hall hosts movie nights throughout the year, and Grand Central Market is every eccentric food lover’s dream, with stalls catering to tastes from oysters to currywurst.

The end of line is Union Station.

The famous transportation hub was built in the 1930s and features historically Spanish architecture. Efforts are currently underway to renovate the station and ensure it remains as important to the city’s future as it was to its past.

But if Union Station is representative of everything Los Angeles has become, Olvera Street – which is directly adjacent – is symbolic of everything it was.

Olvera Street pays homage to the city’s Mexican past, and is the oldest part of downtown Los Angeles. It’s a quiet oasis at an intersection of culture, tranquility and heritage, all contrasted against the backdrop of the towers of finance and industry that dot the skyline of the former pueblo.

[img289 fullwidth]

The Purple Line, more so than any other project Metro is working on, has had a tough time turning its potential energy into kinetic.

The Westside Subway Extension project, as it’s called, runs nearly parallel, though further south to the Red Line, except for a small two-stub segment that runs underneath Wilshire Boulevard to Western Avenue.

Metro has plans to extend the Purple Line all the way to UCLA, but most of that work won’t be completed for another 20 years. In the meantime, check out Koreatown. The Wilshire/Western station resides right in its heart, and there’s a multitude of good Korean barbecue restaurants nearby, such as Castle 2 Korean BBQ, a mere four blocks east of the station.

Aside from that, there’s not much to see along the Purple Line. Not yet, anyway.

[img287 fullwidth]

The newest addition to Metro’s expanding fleet, the Expo Line – short for Exposition Line – will soon be the most accessible to UCLA students. The line is being extended out to Santa Monica, and Metro has plans to run express buses from Westwood down to the line.

It’s projected to be able to run from the ocean to downtown Los Angeles in about 45 minutes, which is unbelievable if you’ve ever sat in traffic on the 10 Freeway.

As it stands, the line is still pretty cool.

[img238 fullwidth]

It starts in the heart of Culver City's downtown district, which has a variety of trendy and chic shops and restaurants just blocks from the station.

Even closer is the Museum of Jurassic Technology. While it may sound like an homage to Jurassic Park, it turns out it's even cooler: The museum is dedicated to eccentric scientists and their inventions, packed together into this one itty-bitty building on Venice Boulevard.

Eventually, the line takes you to USC.

Forget USC, and exit the station to experience one of the most serene places in all of Los Angeles: the Exposition Rose Garden.

The garden is stunning, with 20,000 hedges, 200 different types of roses and picturesque gazebos. Not to mention that it borders the California Science Center, California African American Museum and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles.

[img232 fullwidth]

Continuing eastward, the Expo Line stops directly on Pico Boulevard, near two L.A. landmarks: L.A. Live (Staples Center included) and the Original Pantry Cafe. The Staples Center is very obviously the famous home of the Lakers and Kings (yes, you too Clippers), but the Original Pantry Cafe, which sits just a block or so north, is the real attraction here.

The Pantry claims to have never closed since the 1920s, and you hope it never does. It’s a throwback diner – complete with a cash-only policy. The reuben and breakfast are its specialty, but more important is the respect that transcends generations.

[img227 fullwidth]

Even the dim echo of the plastic water cups off the wooden tables creates a special sound – an earned sound, of age and wisdom. It’s a place that’s done and seen everything this city has to offer, and nearly a hundred years later, it still stands. The food’s good too.

[img288 fullwidth]

The Gold Line is the closest equivalent of the kind of shiny, modern public transit that people put on a pedestal in cities like Seattle or Portland.

But there’s a hidden facet to the Gold Line’s existence: More so than any other line out there, its route, from suburban Pasadena to East Los Angeles, is a microcosm of the city as a whole.

Let’s start with Pasadena.

Take the Gold Line to Del Mar station and you’ll disembark in Old Town, the heart of Pasadena’s tourism industry and the village Westwood wishes it could be.

Taking a stroll down Colorado Boulevard is tantamount to getting smacked in the face with ubiquitous charm and preppy architecture. There’s even the same mixture of nice-looking chain restaurants and niche eateries that Westwood has – places like Umami Burger, 800 Degrees Pizza, a fondue place called The Melting Pot and a bunch of pubs.

[img222 fullwidth]

Head south a few stops and you'll notice how quickly the chic bubble pops. Stop in Chinatown, just north of downtown Los Angeles and situated next to Chavez Ravine, home of the Dodgers.

It’s not Los Angeles’ first Chinatown – that was torn down to make room for (what else) a freeway.

Walk westward about two blocks and you reach the Chinatown Central Plaza. Draped with sky lanterns, the plaza is the central location for the best Chinese food and shops in the city.

[img229 fullwidth]

Heading further south, you reach Union Station once again, but close by is the Little Tokyo and Arts District area.

The Arts District is a little weird. The juxtaposition of brilliant artists in the warehouses-turned-studios and impoverished urban blight mixes in a strange concoction of Los Angeles’ industrial past and its artistic future. Also, Paul McCartney has a gallery there.

In Little Tokyo, you’ll find everything from Kula Sushi, Los Angeles’ oldest sushi bar, to the Japanese American National Museum.

Past Little Tokyo, the line turns east and crosses the depressingly depleted Los Angeles River before stopping at Mariachi Plaza in Boyle Heights. Boyle Heights is one the oldest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and originally heavily Jewish, but over the last couple decades it has become predominantly Latino.

Mariachi Plaza hosts regular concerts and events, and there’s some transcendent Mexican food available there – look no farther than Yeya’s Restaurant or Guisados, two local restaurants close to the plaza.

Walk a few blocks north and you’ll come to Hollenbeck Park. Bordered by South Saint Louis and East 4th streets, the park sits serenely in the middle of a blankly urbanized landscape, with a small pond, geese and an old bridge.

That, in essence, is the Gold Line. From the lily white suburbs of Pasadena to a neighborhood with one of the largest Latino populations in the United States, the Gold Line traverses a region of nearly 20 miles.

----

While there are other fascinating Metro lines that traverse our city (the Blue and Green Lines), these are the routes that are easiest for students to get to.

Even so, reaching Metro lines can be a challenge: You have to take a bus to them first, such as the 2 or the 720.

But bus riding aside, the best pitch I can make for the Metro is this: If you’ve ever been curious about the people and places that make up the urban ecosystem of 13 million people that is the greater Los Angeles area, it’s a good place to start.

Because it’s not what you see on TV that defines this city. It’s the people. It’s the lady on the bus studying for her citizenship exam, the reformed convict who’s looking for another chance, the mother of two on the Red Line, kids going home after school on the Gold Line, the lawyer who works in downtown Los Angeles but commutes on the Expo Line and sometimes, it’s just a guy and his girlfriend trying to get home after a Saturday night.

Yeah, you have your occasional obnoxious person who takes up four seats with all of his or her stuff. But mostly, it's the faces of the living, breathing people that call the city home, who are just trying to go about their day and do the best they can. Cars can insulate, but there’s nowhere to hide on a train.

So take a ride, and don’t forget: There’s a lot outside of Westwood.","",6,,ARTICLE,6
286,Monsters Unseen,monsters-unseen,Daily Bruin Opinion columnist Julia McCarthy on modern evils and overcoming trauma,"[img306 fullwidth]

For Halloween this year, I dressed up as Lorde.

It’s a pretty easy costume to pull off: All you need is some black lipstick, black hair dye and a piercing glare. But beyond the simplicity and affordability of the look – typical college student costume concerns – I think I gravitated toward Lorde for another reason.

Last year, after I was sexually assaulted, I spent the majority of spring quarter pounding Lorde into my head while hiding away on the upper level of Drake Stadium in between classes.

Turning her voice up loud enough drowned out everything else going on in my world and provided temporary solitude. I’d prop my backpack up against the concrete walls and lie on my back, head supported by my books, eyes closed. I’d just let Lorde pound through my brain until I couldn’t focus on anything but the music.

Listening to her music helped stop that terrible feeling you get in your throat in which you really want to cry but can’t get anything to come out – the insanely painful feeling of suppressed sadness.

I only ever get that feeling, that desperate need to cry, a couple of times a year. It’s an emotional state I reserve for only very special occasions.

As weird as that sounds – planning out when I’m allowed to cry – it’s more of a defense mechanism I’ve built to prevent others from having control over my emotional state.

[img301 left]

Once, when I ended things with a guy I was seeing, he called me an “emotionless robot, incapable of love.” I knew he was upset and that it was an offhanded (if not lamely worded) insult, but the statement hurt because it had a hint of truth to it. I’m closed off from my emotions because I don’t want others to have control over them.

Which is why I was in no way prepared to handle the reality that the person who assaulted me had cracked that defense mechanism and had total control over my emotional state, regardless of whether or not he knew it.

Lorde acted as barrier for a few weeks, standing in as my defense mechanism. But eventually, when my headphones were unplugged, and I couldn’t run away to Drake Stadium, I was forced to face the situation head on.

I tried to grapple with why the person who assaulted me had so much power over what I had previously thought was an impenetrable system of self-protection.

Tackling that reality started in my English class that spring.

[img253 right]

Right after I was assaulted, we read an excerpt from Judith Halberstam's book ""Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters."" The essay discusses how the concept of “monsters” has evolved into much more than the traditional depictions of grotesque, fairy-tale characters, and we contrasted this idea with the characters and depictions of monstrosity in ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.""

In her essay, Halberstam presents the idea that modern-day monstrosity is no longer a concept exclusively tied to images of deformed creatures that come out at night, emerge from underneath beds and are the farthest thing from human – essentially the exact way monstrosity is painted in ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.""

Conversely, Halberstam portrays monstrosity as encompassing the belief that monsters are among us, monsters are precisely human and evil “manifests itself as a seamless norm.”

The evolution of monstrosity that Halberstam seems to be alluding to is very closely tied to society’s ability to accept terror in forms beyond traditional portrayals of horror.

Sitting in class the first day we read her piece, I couldn’t shake the feeling that my experience with sexual violence was exactly in line with Halberstam's belief that monsters exist in everyday life, that they are all around us.

My experience with monsters directly challenges preexisting notions of monstrosity being confined to characters like Freddy Krueger and Frankenstein and others that evoke visions of deformity, terror and chaos.

[img297 right]

For me, the most terrifying monsters are utterly normal.

True monsters are the ones walking next to you on Bruin Walk, eating in Covel for Sunday brunch and presenting themselves as the farthest possible conception of what society perceives as evil.

My monster is such a monster: an evil that presents itself in the form of a UCLA student who passes for normal each day. He is a member of a UCLA fraternity, plays sports on the Intramural Field and enjoys B-Plate as much as the rest of us.

Though he fulfills the various standards countless young men at this school hold themselves to, he also meets Halberstam’s ideas of what new monsters look like.

“Monstrosity no longer coagulates into a specific body, a single face, a unique feature; it is replaced with a banality that fractures resistance because the enemy becomes harder to locate and looks more like the hero,” she writes, and this is exactly what this monster is.

He is the villain masquerading as the hero.

----

Calling yourself a victim is a demeaning task.

It’s a label that I would never assign to myself, or rather, never thought I would have to assign to myself. I hate that as I type out these sentences, they echo every personal account I’ve ever read on sexual assault.

The fact that an experience so diverse in context can trigger feelings so similar in individuals who have dealt with these monsters shows the incredible power of monstrosity to cross cultural, socioeconomic and any other type of societal boundaries.

For me, strange as this sounds, this recognition of evil as a cross-cultural phenomenon was a way to displace huge amounts of responsibility I had been pinning on myself. I was the one who had failed to recognize the monster who approached me on the dance floor, letting him kiss me and allowing evil to slither into my world without having to pass any barriers.

These monsters affect an individual’s ability to recognize horror. Without features like grotesque skin to serve as warnings, these monsters slip through cracks and evade recognition.

The power of society in shaping our perceptions of monstrosity is an interesting commentary on how we regulate our fears and horrors, only taking on fears we are ready to confront.

Rapists aren’t a new concept emerging only in the 21st century. Why is that we are just now deciding to label and classify them as monsters?

These monsters have been there all along.

In ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" there is a concerted effort to hide this glaring monstrosity, this monstrous disruption: a need to mask the terror when it emerges to prevent recognition of the evil.

But modern-day monsters don’t have to worry about being recognized as evil. Their invisible nature and complete ability to blend in with the rest of us destroy all barriers between what we believe monsters look like and what they actually do. Modern-day monsters thrive precisely on an ability to elude restrictions between their world of evil and our world of the ordinary.

Blasting Lorde until my eardrums hurt was a temporary fix to a bigger problem: It let me continue to ignore the real cause of my emotional distress.

I wasn’t upset because I’d failed to maintain a system of self-defense, and I wasn’t upset because I’d cried in front of my English class on the first day we read Halberstam’s essay, completely spooked by how relatable the words on the page were to my real-life experience.

I was upset because I’d been assaulted.

I was upset that someone could do that to another human being: rip total control and humanity from a person while masquerading as normal. For some reason, recognizing the true cause of the incredible aching sadness in my throat was the hardest thing for me to do.

But when I finally took out my headphones and allowed myself to feel – to be sad, mad, upset and angry – I was able to regain the control that had been stolen from me.","",7,,ARTICLE,6
287,Letter from the Editors,letter-editors, ,"Dear readers,

Fall is a profoundly contradictory time for students. As the start of a new academic year coincides with the end of the calendar year, we’re torn between celebrating fresh starts and acknowledging inevitable endings.

This fall issue of prime magazine is no exception to that paradox. Although this is our first issue as editors – our own blank slate – the world of magazine journalism grows bleaker every day. We’re starting anew at a time when periodicals like this one are slowly but surely ceasing to exist.

And yet, prime is still here.

This issue of prime has unintentionally come to represent survival – both our own as a magazine, and that of others. Nearly every story on our pages, in its own way, represents the survival of someone or something.

From an incisive take on campus mental health to saving endangered public art to moving past the trauma of sexual violence – the stories in prime tell more than just facts and information. They tell tales of hope, strength, success and, ultimately, the ability to overcome.

And while there’s more to prime than just these stories – our lifestyle section has the best of winter fashion, fall bites and do-it-yourself dorm decor – they really are the heart and soul of our magazine.

It has been a profoundly rewarding experience editing this issue of prime. We hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed creating it.

Love,

Midday or midnight, this snack habit is usually the adversary of my dinner appetite and my waistline. After almost four years of college, I have finally learned how to channel my snack cravings into a healthy habit with fruit and veggie chips.

# Basic recipe

[img74 fullwidth]

Slice fruits and veggies as thinly as possible. Though you can use a sharp knife to make all your cuts, I highly recommend purchasing a mandolin – it’s totally worth the investment. Our local City Target has them for about $13.

[img73 fullwidth]

Using a separate bowl for each chip flavor, lightly toss vegetables in olive oil – just enough to cover each piece. For fruits, toss apples and pears in lemon juice – again, using just enough to cover each piece. Do not oversaturate your fruits and veggies. Avoid berries – too much juice and sugar – but mangoes also make excellent candidates.

[img75 fullwidth]

Add desired seasonings to the bowl in proportions based on your own preferences. See the table below for our ideas.

[img125 fullwidth]

After coating chips in the bowls with olive oil/lemon juice and seasonings, lay each piece on a prepared baking sheet lined with parchment paper. (Note: If you use aluminum foil to cover your cookie sheets, make sure to use butter to grease the foil. Otherwise, the sugar will stick and your chips will burn to a crisp.) Ensure that pieces do not touch.

[img72 fullwidth]

Sprinkle a light layer of seasonings of your choice over the chips.

Bake at the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit noted on the table below. Multiple types can be baked on the same sheet or at the same time, but make sure you watch them carefully. The line between “perfect” and “burnt” is a matter of minutes.

Flip the chips using a fork, spatula or tongs midway through baking. Chips are finished when the edges begin to crisp and curl and the pieces are no longer floppy or moist.

Toss the veggie chips with sea salt just prior to serving if desired.

[img76 fullwidth]

Chips may be kept in an airtight container or bag for up to one week (if you don’t eat them all before then).

## Tips from my kitchen to yours

- You can find rennet and citric acid powder at Whole Foods Market for $13.
- Milk: Stay away from ultra high temperature (UHT) pasteurized milk. This method of pasteurization denatures the proteins in the milk, preventing them from being able to fully solidify into curds. Whole milk will produce a very rich, soft mozzarella. One percent will make a harder, more string cheese-like cheese. Avoid fat-free milk, as this will make the cheese too rubbery. Raw milk is the best option, though it's typically hard to find.

# Ingredients

- 1 ½ teaspoons of citric acid powder
- ¼ teaspoon liquid vegetable rennet combined with 1 cup water
- 1 gallon of milk: whole, 1 percent or 2 percent, not UHT pasteurized
- 1 teaspoon salt

# In your kitchen

- Large sauce pot
- Slotted spoon (preferably metal)
- Cooking thermometer (ideally with a probe)

[img146 fullwidth]


1. Sprinkle the citric acid powder (after crushing the tablets) into a cool, large stockpot. Pour ¼ cup water over it and stir to dissolve.

2. Pour the milk into the citric acid solution and stir to combine. [img147 fullwidth]

3. Put the pot over medium-low heat and heat it to 90 degrees (use an instant-read thermometer). You may notice the milk beginning to curdle – this is a good thing.

4. When the milk reaches 90 degrees, remove the pan from the burner and pour in the rennet mixed with water.

5. Stir the mixture with a gentle, circular up-and-down motion for about 30 seconds, then use the spoon to stop the motion of the milk

6. Place the lid on the pot and leave it for five minutes. After five minutes, the mixture should resemble a very soft custard.

7. With a knife long enough to reach the bottom of the pot, cut the curd into a 1-inch checkerboard pattern, making lines across, then lines perpendicularly.

8. Return the pot to the burner over medium heat and stir it gently until the temperature of the whey (the liquid that separates from the curd) reaches 105 degrees.

9. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the curd to a colander placed over a bowl.

10. Slowly spin around the colander to allow the whey to drain from the curd.

11. Remove the curd and gently squeeze it a few times to drain away excess whey.

12. Transfer the curd to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it on high for one minute.

13. Remove the bowl from the microwave and pour off as much whey as you can. You can preserve all the excess whey and use it to make bread or add it to beverages to make them higher in protein.

14. Press the curd together with your hands and again drain away the whey that comes out.

15. Microwave the curd again on high for 35 seconds, then press it together to drain more whey.

16. Knead and stretch the curd a bit to drain more whey, then microwave it one last time for 35 seconds. [img148 fullwidth]

17. Knead in the salt and roll it under itself until it forms a neat ball. Then place the ball into an ice water bath and let it rest there until cool. [img149 fullwidth]

Relatively simple to make, this “pinteresting” recipe is a winning addition to any dinner party, afternoon picnic, Sunday afternoon baking session, study snack, late-night splurge or even breakfast treat.

# Ingredients:

[img12 fullwidth]

- 4 Fuji apples, peeled and medium-small diced

- ¼ cup white sugar, plus 1/8 teaspoon white sugar for egg wash

- ¼ cup brown sugar

- 2 tablespoons honey

- ½ teaspoon cinnamon

- 3 tablespoons apricot jam (can be substituted with strawberry or peach for different flavors)

- 2 tablespoons corn starch

- 2 tablespoons water

- 1 egg yolk

- ¼ cup milk

- Kosher salt

- 2 refrigerated pie crusts

# Instructions:

[img13 fullwidth]

Preheat oven to 400° F. In a medium saucepan, bring apples, sugar, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, jam and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt to a light simmer on medium-low heat. Simmer for 15-20 minutes on low heat with the saucepan uncovered.

----------

[img14 fullwidth]

Combine water and corn starch with a fork to create a slurry, and slowly pour into the apple mixture while stirring. Let cook for 2 minutes. Take off the heat and let cool.

----------

[img15 fullwidth]

Prepare egg wash by mixing an egg yolk, milk, 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/8 teaspoon sugar. (not pictured)

----------

[img16 fullwidth]

Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. Take out one refrigerated pie crust and cut out as many circles as possible (around 12). Place them on the parchment paper. Place the lollipop sticks at the top of each pie circle and push them in, but not so they go all the way through the circle.

----------

[img17 fullwidth]

Place around 1 to 2 teaspoons of apple filling in the middle of each pie circle. Roll out the second pie crust and cut out the same number of circles as from the first pie crust.

----------

[img18 fullwidth]

Brush egg wash using the back of a spoon or a pastry brush on the rim around the filling for the pie pops. Cover the filling and seal with the remaining pie circles. Press the edges together with a fork and poke holes into the tops of each pie, just puncturing the crust.

----------

[img19 fullwidth]

Brush the tops with more egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 400° F for 15-20 minutes, or just until the crust is golden brown.

----------

[img20 fullwidth]

## Tips from our kitchen to yours:

- Don’t skip the apricot jam or corn starch in this recipe – these are the secrets to perfect consistency in the pie filling.

- Mix and match the apples to your taste for a full realm of flavors – we used a combination of Pink Lady, Fuji and Gala.

- Healthier substitutions can also be made with agave in lieu of honey, and coconut milk in lieu of whole milk.

- No lollipop sticks? No problem. Chopsticks make the perfect substitute (and dare we say they’re even more effective because they are substantial enough to hold the surprisingly weighty little pie).

- If you can, try to resist the temptation to eat the pops right away. Allowing them to cool will prevent the pies from sliding down the sticks.

296,Recipe: Tea Time,recipe-tea-time,"A tea for every occasion
","[img378 fullwidth]

Like many UCLA students, I am no stranger to copious amounts of espresso shots during finals week. Since weeks five through finals tend to be powered by caffeine, I often find myself wanting a break from the perpetual coffee aftertaste. For me, tea is a luxury reserved for those few slow days of the quarter. A lazy Saturday afternoon with Netflix or a quiet night after a long day.

I once heard a rather passionate rant about how tea is a scam: It looks and smells like it should taste amazing, but actually tastes like water. As a fervent tea enthusiast who grew up in a culture in which tea and water are synonymous, I beg to differ. Tea doesn’t have to just be a colored hot water sipped on a cold day. Whether you are in the mood for a refreshing fruity cocktail or a decadent drinkable dessert, any time can be tea time.

[img383 fullwidth]

My first inspiration comes from Taiwanese tea bars that offer dozens of cocktail-like tea drinks. I clearly remember the day I was introduced to this world of beverages. On our way home from shopping in Taipei, my cousin and I stopped by a tea chain store called Share Tea. She ordered a strawberry black tea, which wasn’t so much strawberry-infused tea as it was a couple spoonfuls of strawberry preserves shaken into the iced tea. It was surprisingly good. From that point forward, I set out to try every fruity combination. My personal favorite is orange jasmine green tea, a rather random combination, but I like to think of it as a Taiwanese twist on the popular Arnold Palmer drink.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 green tea bags

* 1 pitcher or bottle of water

* 1 large orange

* 1/4 cup simple syrup

* Ice cubes

**Steps:**

1. Submerge the two green tea bags in the pitcher of water, and refrigerate for at least eight hours. This creates “cold brew” tea, which is less tannic than hot tea, has lower levels of caffeine and has proven to be high in antioxidants.

2. Cut the orange in half and squeeze out the juice and pulp.

3. Add simple syrup to the orange juice and combine.

4. For each serving, pour one part orange juice and four parts green tea over ice, stir and enjoy!

The first time I tasted this heavenly cocktail was from a Baileys truck parked outside one of the tallest buildings in the world, Taipei 101. A shot of Irish cream liqueur was poured into a cup of chilled Sun Moon Lake black tea at the makeshift bar. This decadent dessert-drink will be well-appreciated by any boba lover!

* 4 black tea bags

* 3 cups boiling water

* 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup water

**Steps:**

1. Bring a pot of water to boil and let the tea bags steep for at least 10 minutes.

2. In another pot, boil one cup of water and stir in the brown sugar until dissolved.

3. Remove tea bags and pour in sugar water to the tea. Let cool until room temperature.

4. Fill up glasses with ice cubes and pour in tea three-fourths of the way.

5. Top off with a shot of Irish cream liqueur and enjoy!

This recipe is inspired by the framboise mojitos served in a bar near my host family’s apartment in Paris from my summer abroad. Light and refreshing white tea pairs well with fruit, making it the perfect touch to this summery cocktail.

**Ingredients:**

* 6 ounces white rum

* 1 ounce simple syrup

* ¼ cup raspberries and blueberries

* Crushed ice

----------

[img24 fullwidth]

Let the map soak for 10 to15 minutes, flipping it over about halfway through. Carefully take the map out of the tray, letting any remaining coffee drip back into the tray. The map is fragile and can easily rip if not handled carefully.

301,DIY: Memory Making,diy-memory-making,Create your own college memory boxes,"[img385 fullwidth]

For most students, college only lasts four years.

It’s made up of highs and lows, personal growth, new friends and exciting experiences. But once it’s over, college is just a pile of memories.

And while those memories will stay with you forever, the memories that are tangible, the ones you can hold and touch, deserve a special home.

That’s where memory boxes come in.

You take the physical memories – ticket stubs from Bruin Bash, pictures of friends, funny notes – and put them together in a box. Your JazzReggae Festival ticket from freshman year sits next to your first college wine cork and a printed-out grad picture. The evidence that you were here, that you did go to UCLA, is all in your hands.

Then you take an ordinary box – doesn't matter what size or shape – and you decorate it in a way that expresses who you were in college, or what your journey here was about. Style it however you like – we recommend paint or decoupage. All that matters is that it's yours.

The prime editors made our own memory boxes, using different techniques, to symbolize the things that are important to us about our college experience. Whether it’s school spirit, our study abroad experience or our quirky pop culture tastes, each box represents a facet of our own UCLA journey.

And it’s easy to make your own.
